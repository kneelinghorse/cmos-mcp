3. [Result/next step]
4. [Continuation or completion]

**[Include both happy path and key error scenarios]**

---

## 8) Performance, Caching & SLOs

### SLO Targets

**[List key performance optimizations:]**

- [Optimization 1]
- [Optimization 2]

---

## 9) Security, Governance, Cost Controls

### Authentication (AuthN)

**[How do users/services prove identity?]**

### Authorization (AuthZ)

**[How are permissions enforced?]**

### Quotas & Rate Limits

**[What limits exist to prevent abuse/overspending?]**

### Audit Trail

**[What actions are logged for compliance/security?]**

### Cost Controls

**[How is spending monitored and limited?]**

---

## 10) Observability

### Metrics

**[List key metrics to track:]**

**System Metrics:**

- `metric_name`: [what it measures, why it matters]
- `metric_name`: [what it measures, why it matters]

**Infrastructure Metrics:**

- `metric_name`: [what it measures, why it matters]

### Tracing

**[Define key trace spans:]**

- [operation] → [sub-operation] → [result]

### Events

**[List important events to capture:]**

- `event.name`: [when triggered, what data included]

---
