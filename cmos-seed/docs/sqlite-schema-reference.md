| `proposals`            | Drafted records awaiting the operator     | `id`, `text`, `kind`, `outcome`, `created_at`, `record_id`   |

**Views**:

- `project_identity` - Stable project identity and schema markers
- `active_missions` - Convenience projection for current work
- `mission_details` - Missions joined to sprint titles and extended fields
- `sprint_summary` - Dynamically calculated mission and decision counts

`proposals` holds drafts (`Would record:` lines) until the operator answers them; it is outside
search and sync events. A decision recorded from a draft keeps how its approval was known in
`strategic_decisions.approval_mode`, `approval_draft` and `approval_words`.
The mode is `approved`, `agent-judged`, `agent-attested`, or a direct caller's declared
`autonomous`; NULL means the mode was not recorded. Draft proposals retain their existing
three approval modes.

Decision reasoning lives in nullable `context_text`, `alternatives` (JSON string array),
`consequences` and `deciders` (JSON string array). The decision FTS index covers the headline
and all four fields. A write-time migration upgrades the seven nullable shape/approval columns
and owned FTS objects atomically, then writes `metadata.decision_shape_columns=1`; reads do not
run that migration, and old records keep their original text with NULL new fields.

`record_links` stores unique directed textual citation endpoint pairs with `typed` or `bare`
resolution; typed evidence wins when both cite the same target. Canonical decision fields and
array items are parsed separately. Both endpoints must be local (or legacy NULL origin), with a
known target timestamp strictly earlier than its source. Bare numbers must be unambiguous across
decisions, learnings, constraints, next steps and feedback. Reads revalidate current origin, time
and collision eligibility; supersession follows `strategic_decisions.superseded_by` separately.
The owned write-time migration creates/backfills the table atomically and stamps
`metadata.record_links_schema=1` last. Required source rows and link repair share their writer's
transaction. Old stores read explicit typed references without writing a migration; query failures
produce named warnings. Derived links may be removed when endpoint eligibility changes.

Runtime migrations may add tables such as `agent_feedback` and optional search/vector structures.

## Useful Queries

### Mission Counts by Sprint

```sql
SELECT sprint_id, status, COUNT(*) as count
FROM missions
GROUP BY sprint_id, status
ORDER BY sprint_id IS NULL,
         CASE
           WHEN sprint_id GLOB 'sprint-[0-9]*'
            AND substr(sprint_id, 8) NOT GLOB '*[^0-9]*'
           THEN CAST(substr(sprint_id, 8) AS INTEGER)
         END DESC,
         sprint_id COLLATE BINARY DESC,
         status;
```

### Find Open Missions

```sql
SELECT id, name, status, completed_at
FROM missions
WHERE status IN ('Current', 'In Progress', 'Queued')
ORDER BY CASE status
           WHEN 'In Progress' THEN 1
           WHEN 'Current' THEN 2
           WHEN 'Queued' THEN 3
           ELSE 4
         END,
         id;
```

### View Sprint Progress

```sql
SELECT sprint_id AS id, title,
       completed_missions || '/' || total_missions as progress,
       status, blocked_missions, active_missions
FROM sprint_summary
ORDER BY start_date DESC, sprint_id COLLATE BINARY DESC;
```

### Get Recent Activity Events

```sql
SELECT ts, mission, action, status, summary
FROM session_events
ORDER BY ts DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### Review Planning/Onboarding Sessions

```sql
SELECT id, type, title, started_at, completed_at, status
FROM sessions
WHERE type IN ('planning', 'onboarding')
ORDER BY started_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### List Mission Rows for a Sprint

```sql
SELECT id, name, status, completed_at, notes
FROM missions
WHERE sprint_id = 'sprint-05'
ORDER BY id;
```

### Check Context Updates

```sql
SELECT id, updated_at,
       LENGTH(content) as size_bytes
FROM contexts
ORDER BY updated_at DESC;
```

### View Context History

```sql
SELECT created_at, session_id, source,
       LENGTH(content) as size_bytes
FROM context_snapshots
WHERE context_id = 'master_context'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

## Accessing the Database

Use any SQLite client:

**Command line**:

```bash
sqlite3 cmos/db/cmos.sqlite

# Run query
sqlite3 cmos/db/cmos.sqlite "SELECT * FROM sprints;"

# Interactive mode
sqlite3 cmos/db/cmos.sqlite
> .tables
> .schema missions
> SELECT * FROM missions LIMIT 5;
```

**GUI tools** (any will work):

- DB Browser for SQLite
- DBeaver
- TablePlus
- DataGrip
- VS Code SQLite extension
- etc.

All standard SQLite tools work for reads without special configuration.

## Schema Details

See `cmos/db/schema.sql` for the shipped base schema including:

- Table definitions with foreign keys
- Indexes for query performance
- Views for common queries
- Constraints and defaults

## Maintenance Queries

### Compact Database

Back up the database and stop the MCP server (or otherwise ensure there are no active writers)
before running `VACUUM`.

```sql
VACUUM;
```

### Check Database Size

```sql
SELECT page_count * page_size as size_bytes
FROM pragma_page_count(), pragma_page_size();
```

### Verify Foreign Keys

```sql
PRAGMA foreign_key_check;
```

### List All Tables

```sql
SELECT name
FROM sqlite_schema
WHERE type = 'table'
  AND name NOT LIKE 'sqlite_%'
ORDER BY name;
```
