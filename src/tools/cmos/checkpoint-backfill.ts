 * Checkpoint Backfill — Fire-and-Forget Dashboard Sync

 * Fallback path: event-replay via cmosDbBackfill when no project slug is available.
 *
 * Auto-registers the project with the dashboard on first checkpoint if not
 * already registered (checks `dashboard_registered` metadata flag).

/**
 * s86-m01 — write diagnostics straight to fd 2 instead of through the console
 * object.
 *
 * This module's work happens inside a fire-and-forget async IIFE
 * (`triggerCheckpointBackfill`) that deliberately outlives its caller. Under Jest
 * that body can still be in flight when a suite finishes, and Jest replaces the
 * global console object at teardown, so a late error write through it throws
 * "Cannot log after tests are done" — which surfaces as a nonzero exit AFTER a
 * fully green run (the CI flake root-caused in decision #970 and re-diagnosed in
 * s86-m01). `process.stderr` is not patched, so the same line lands without
 * arming that trap.
 *
 * Production behaviour is byte-identical: a stdio MCP server's error logging
 * already writes to fd 2, and stdout is reserved for the JSON-RPC channel.
 * In-tree precedent: `warnLegacyAuth` (dashboard-client.ts) already writes this way.
 *
 * The structural gate tests/tools/cmos/detached-log-gate.test.ts (Arm A) keeps
 * this module — and the other two on this path — free of console calls.
