/**
 * WHY A LEASE. Next-steps and carry-forwards accumulated with no way to expire: rows #486-#506
 * were six closes old at sprint-91 planning and nothing had disposed of them. Policy 2 (operator,
 * 2026-09-17): a row holds a lease that lapses unless renewed. CARRY is the renewal — it stamps
 * `resolved_at` and resets the clock. REOPEN clears `resolved_at`, so the clock restarts from
 * `created_at`: a reopened row is deliberately not renewed by being reopened.
 *
 * s92-m02 — WHAT A CLOSE IS. 3.1.0 counted a close by `sprints.end_date`, and `cmos_sprint(complete)`
 * kept a PLANNED end date when one was set (`COALESCE(end_date, ?)`). A sprint planned to end next
 * week but closed today therefore counted as a close survived by rows carried after it closed:
 * TraceLab lost 58 freshly carried rows that way (its feedback #83). Since 3.2.0 every close stamps
 * its actual close time, a one-time repair re-dates the sprints that kept a planned date, and the
 * count itself ignores any end_date still in the future.
 *
 * CALENDAR BOUNDS (operator Q4, decision #1161): a row is never dropped before it is
 * {@link LEASE_MIN_AGE_DAYS} days past its lease anchor, however many closes it survived (TraceLab
 * dropped never-carried rows aged 8–14 days after five closes in 45 hours); and a row that has
 * survived no close at all is flagged idle after {@link LEASE_IDLE_WARN_DAYS} days. Nothing is ever
 * dropped by the calendar alone.
 *
 * NO SCHEMA CHANGE. The anchors (`created_at`, the last carry's `resolved_at`) and every close's
 * `sprints.end_date` are already on disk.
