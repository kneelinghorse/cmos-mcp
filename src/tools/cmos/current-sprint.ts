/**
 * Canonical current-sprint resolver (s77-m02).
 *
 * Before s77 there were FOUR divergent "current sprint" pickers, and two of them
 * disagreed on a multi-Active store: onboard's `getExplicitOpenSprintId` ordered
 * `start_date DESC` (newest wins) while mission-status' `findActiveSprint` ordered
 * `start_date ASC` (oldest wins) — the recorded s75 #853 split (A said sprint-76,
 * B said sprint-75). This module is the single source of truth every surface now
 * delegates to, so they can never disagree again.
 *
 * The write-time invariant (s77-m01) keeps any store THIS server writes to a
 * single open sprint; this read-side resolver is the safety net for legacy /
 * foreign stores we don't control that already hold two open sprints.
 *
 * `resolveCurrentSprintId` returns the sprint ID only; callers layer their own
 * context/shape on top (onboard's `getSprintContextById`, mission-status'
 * `isComplete`, etc.).

/**
 * Resolve the sprint ID for a DURABLE WRITE — or `null` when nothing is open (s85-m03).

 * **Read and write semantics diverge ON PURPOSE. Do not converge them.**
 *
 * {@link resolveCurrentSprintId} must ALWAYS be able to name a sprint, because a display
 * surface asking "which sprint am I looking at?" has no useful answer otherwise. That is why
 * its Steps 5–6 re-admit Completed sprints. Those same fallbacks are wrong for a durable
 * stamp: on a store whose sprints are all Completed they hand a dead sprint to the write
 * path, and the row keeps that label forever. Live evidence: this store has 76 sprints and
 * ZERO open; six planning sessions were stamped to sprints completed weeks earlier. An
 * external report (parts-town, 2026-07-30) independently found three months of engagement
 * work absorbed by a sprint closed in April — and on a Managed-tier project, which has no
 * sprints by design, there is never an open sprint to catch a session, so the mislabel is
 * guaranteed rather than incidental.
 *
 * The s77-m02 comment at cmos-session-start.ts:293-296 is exactly how the two got merged in
 * the first place: routing the write path through the display resolver looked like removing a
 * divergence. It removed the wrong one.
 *
 * Two legs, then null:
 *  1. **Active work** — the Step 1 query verbatim. Excludes only DEAD_SPRINT_STATUSES, so it
 *     correctly catches a `'Planned'` sprint that carries an In Progress mission.
 *  2. **Open status** — {@link getOpenStatusSprintId}, which is NOT
 *     `getExplicitOpenSprintId`. See that function's note for why reusing it would be a bug.
 *
 * Everything Steps 3–6 would have added is deliberately dropped. Note the real behavior delta
 * that follows: a `'Planned'` sprint whose missions are all Queued no longer receives the
 * write tag, though display still names it.
