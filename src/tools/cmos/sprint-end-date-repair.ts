/**
 * WHY. Before 3.2.0 `cmos_sprint(complete)` wrote `end_date = COALESCE(end_date, ?)`, so a sprint
 * planned to end on 10-08 but closed on 10-02 kept 10-08. The lease counts a close by end_date, so
 * every row carried between 10-02 and 10-08 counted that sprint as a close it survived. Measured on
 * a TraceLab copy: 9 Completed sprints carry such a date (42–47, 49, 55, 65); this repo has 1
 * (sprint-54).
 *
 * THE ANCHOR is the recorded close, in this order:
 *   1. the latest `session_events` row with action='sprint_complete' and mission=<sprint> — written
 *      at every close since the event log existed (70 of 82 sprints here, all 9 TraceLab ones);
 *   2. else the latest `sprint_complete:<sprint>` context snapshot's created_at — rarer, because
 *      that snapshot is deduped on content hash (none of the 9).
 * A sprint with neither is left as it is and itemized as UNANCHORED: nothing on disk says when it
 * closed, so no date is invented for it.
 *
 * ONLY LATER DATES MOVE. A Completed sprint whose end_date is null, unparseable, or not later than
 * its anchor is untouched — so a correctly dated store sees no lease change at all.
 *
 * ONE-TIME, MARKER-GATED: `metadata.sprint_end_date_repair_v1` records when it ran. Callers run it
 * inside the close transaction, so a close that refuses or rolls back also rolls back the repair
 * and its marker, and the next close retries it.
