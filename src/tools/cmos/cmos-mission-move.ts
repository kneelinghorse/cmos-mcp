/**
 * Sprint 86 m08 — a supported sprint re-binding.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. `missions.sprint_id` carries two different facts in one column: "which sprint
 * CREATED this mission" and "which sprint OWNS its execution". For every mission written before
 * sprint-85 those were the same fact, so nothing forced them apart. They diverged the first time
 * a sprint took in defect work mid-flight, and the column answered with the creating sprint —
 * the only thing `cmos_mission(add)` can know. Until now the sole repair was raw SQL against
 * durable state (`cmos-mission-update.ts`'s fieldMapping has no `sprint_id` entry), so the
 * operator's real choice was between a wrong number and an out-of-band write.
 *
 * THE HARM IS NOT KPI COSMETICS. `resolveCurrentSprintId` step 1 returns the sprint of any
 * In Progress/Current mission, excluding only the DEAD sprint statuses — 'Completed' is NOT in
 * that set. So starting a mission bound to a closed sprint makes that CLOSED sprint the system's
 * current sprint, and `inferSprintIdForDecisionCapture` then stamps it onto every decision,
 * learning and constraint captured in the session. Onboarding also scopes Queued missions to the
 * active sprint, so a re-queued mission on the wrong sprint never surfaces at all.
 *
 * WHY IT IS AN ACTION ON `cmos_mission` AND NOT A TRANSITION.
 * `CMOS_MISSION_TRANSITION_ACTIONS` is exactly the six STATUS transitions. A sprint re-binding
 * changes a CRUD field, not a status — it belongs beside list/show/add/update/depends.
 *
 * THE ID IS NOT RENUMBERED, DELIBERATELY. Four tables carry `REFERENCES missions`
 * (mission_dependencies, session_missions, agent_feedback, next_steps) plus the session_events
 * trail. The `s85-` prefix on a moved mission is a CREATION-TIME LABEL, not an ownership claim;
 * the formatter says so rather than pretending otherwise.
