/**
 * Measured before this module existed (24 registered stores, read-only, MB = 2^20 bytes): snapshot
 * content was 367.6 MB of 667.9 MB on disk. The copies a session or mission close writes after
 * persisting its context were 282.7 MB of it (76.9%), and the legacy
 * `session_runtime`/`mission_runtime` copies another 58.8 MB. No query path reads them. Everything else is either a recovery copy taken before
 * content is trimmed, condensed or migrated, a milestone, or something a person asked for.
 *
 * THE RULE: every snapshot stores its content except a close's persist copy, and that copy keeps
 * its content too when the live context row it copies failed to write, because it is then the one
 * durable copy of the aggregated content (s86-m02b). A content-less copy is written with
 * `content_pruned_at` stamped and its hash prefixed `pruned:`, so it is never a dedup hit, for this
 * code or an older server sharing the store: a later identical write stores its own content.
 *
 * DEDUP PROTECTION (the s92-m09 critic's B2): every site deduplicates on (context, content hash),
 * and a site that reuses an existing row records THAT row's id and source, not its own. A named
 * snapshot, a sprint milestone or a recovery copy that landed on an update copy would therefore be
 * classified, and pruned, as an update copy. So a site reuses a row only when a prune will keep
 * that row at least as long as the site's own row (`findReusableSnapshot`); otherwise it stores a
 * new one. A recovery copy's 30 days run from its own creation, so a recovery copy stands only on a
 * row no prune reclaims, or on an identical recovery copy under a minute old (a repeated attempt,
 * whose window is then short by under a minute).
