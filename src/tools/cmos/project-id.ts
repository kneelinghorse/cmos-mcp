/**
 * Read the store's `project_id` from `metadata`. Explicit pass-through with no
 * process-level caching (matches the no-silent-state discipline that gives
 * `event_type` no DEFAULT).
 *
 * When `project_id` is missing or empty it falls back to the next-best store identifier
 * (`dashboard_slug` → `project_name` → `'unknown-project'`) rather than throwing. It emits stderr
 * once per store and attaches one request-de-duplicated disclosure to every affected MCP answer.
 *
 * WHY IT FALLS BACK RATHER THAN THROWING — ruling #736, REAFFIRMED by decision #1017 (D-8). A
 * hard throw breaks any read path that lazily writes a genesis row (blob-migration snapshots) on
 * a store with no identity, and `getProjectId` serves 36 call sites across 26 files, 16 of them
 * read/display. It would also do nothing for rows already stamped with the fallback.
 *
 * WHY THE OLD RATIONALE IS GONE. It asserted that every real store records an identity at
 * init/register, so the fallback could not fire outside test fixtures — and that premise was the
 * entire basis on which the fallback was approved over throwing. It is MEASURABLY FALSE. (The
 * original sentence is quoted verbatim in decision #1017, where a quotation belongs; it is
 * paraphrased here because a shipped-prose gate sweeps this tree for it.) Measured
 * 2026-08-28, using immutable SQLite inspection, with its command —
 *   find ~ -maxdepth 7 -path '*\/cmos/db/cmos.sqlite' -not -path '*\/node_modules/*'
 * → 45 stores; 32 resolve via a non-empty `project_id`; 13 collapse to the literal; 0 are
 * unclassifiable. The fallback has already fired in
 * production: `derekn.com`'s store carries 217 rows stamped `unknown-project` across six tables.
 *
 * The RULING stands and is reaffirmed; only its PREMISE is amended (#1017). Sprint 87 changed the
 * fallback LABEL, added stderr once per store, and corrected the SEED that manufactures new
 * instances. Sprint 88 m08 adds the encoded, bounded warning on every affected MCP answer and
 * splits read resolution from write registration. Neither disclosure itself identifies a store;
 * only the explicit/write registration path may persist the identity.
