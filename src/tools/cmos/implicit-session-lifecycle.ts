/**
 * WHY THE HANDLER AND NOT THE ROUTER. cmos_session(complete) through the router uploads the whole
 * store as a checkpoint (cmos-session.ts → checkpoint-backfill.ts). A close nobody asked for must not
 * upload anything, so every close here calls cmosSessionComplete directly. The handler is still the
 * right door: it materializes the session's deferred captures (next-steps, constraints) and writes
 * the close event, exactly as a requested complete does.
 *
 * NO NESTED CONNECTIONS. cmosSessionComplete opens its own client. Each function here reads its
 * candidates in one client, lets that client close, and only then calls the handler, once per
 * candidate, so no close runs inside another call's connection or transaction.
 *
 * NO REGISTRATION. A close nobody asked for registers nothing in the project graph: SessionEnd in a
 * second checkout of a registered project would otherwise be refused as a collision and leave the
 * harness session open (the m01 build critic, B3).
