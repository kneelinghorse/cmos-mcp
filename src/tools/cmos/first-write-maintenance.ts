 * repairs reads used to run run here instead: the staleness repair (decision #1191), a pending
 * master_context blob migration, and the rebuild of a search index a read found out of step. They
 * run in the MCP server only, never in a hook verb, after the call's own work so the store is
 * registered first.
 *
 * Once per process per store, not once per store: older CMOS servers on the same machine keep
 * re-flagging restored rows until they restart, and a one-time marker would stop the re-repair.
 * Only a store this pass could read counts as done, so an unreadable one is tried again.
