/**
 * Content sanitizer for XML marshalling artifacts.
 *
 * Sprint 56 m02 — root cause: when an agent emits a tool call like
 *   <parameter name="content">...text...</content>
 * with a misspelled closing tag (e.g. `</content` missing the trailing `>`),
 * the harness's XML→JSON marshaller absorbs the following
 * `<parameter name="missionId">` block as literal string content. The JSON
 * that reaches the MCP server is schema-valid (the `content` field is just
 * a very long string), so the write succeeds and corruption lives forever.
 *
 * Strategy: scan incoming free-text fields for the literal `<parameter …>`
 * or `</parameter …>` / `<content …>` / `</content …>` patterns outside
 * triple-backtick code fences AND inline backtick spans (Sprint 65 m04).
 * When detected, strip from the artifact onwards and surface a per-field
 * warning on the tool response so the calling agent can re-emit.
 *
 * Legitimate content inside ```…``` fences (embedded code samples) and inside
 * `…` inline spans (prose quoting a tag name as data, e.g. `<content>`) is
 * preserved — these are the places an agent may genuinely include these
 * tokens. Unclosed fences / dangling backticks still trigger sanitization;
 * the protection only applies to balanced delimiter pairs.
 *
 * @module intelligence/content-sanitizer
