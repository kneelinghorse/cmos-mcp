# Security posture

This document describes what CMOS-MCP does with your data, credentials, and network — plainly and
truthfully. Every claim below names the source it rests on — a file in the
[source repository](https://github.com/kneelinghorse/cmos-mcp) and, where it helps, the function or
constant to look for — so you can verify it. (The npm package ships compiled code, so the links point
at the repository.) If something here does not match the code, that is a bug in this document —
please report it.

CMOS-MCP is a **local-first** MCP server. The default, fully-supported mode is: a stdio server running
on your machine, reading and writing a single SQLite file in your project. Nothing listens on a
network port. Ordinary local-only operations do not contact the dashboard. Dashboard-backed tool
calls can, and startup may conditionally recover a missing project key when a registered project and
usable stored user credential make that recovery possible. Authentication bootstrap can use the
baked default host without an environment setting.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please report security issues via the GitHub issue tracker
([github.com/kneelinghorse/cmos-mcp/issues](https://github.com/kneelinghorse/cmos-mcp/issues)). For a
sensitive report you would rather not file publicly, open a minimal issue asking for a private channel
and we will follow up. There is no bug-bounty program.

## What listens on the network

**Nothing.** CMOS-MCP is a stdio MCP server (`bin: cmos-mcp` → `dist/bin.js`, `package.json`, which
starts the server from `dist/index.js` when given no verb). It speaks JSON-RPC over stdin/stdout to its
MCP host and opens **no** listening socket. The same bin's CLI verbs (`cmos-mcp hook …`) run once and
exit; they open no socket either.

A previous release also shipped an HTTP transport bin (`cmos-mcp-http`) that bound a port with
`Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`, no authentication, and full read-write access to every registered
store. **It has been removed** — source, bin, export, script, docs, and PM2 config are all deleted
(see the `[2.0.0] → Removed` entry in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)). There is no unauthenticated
network surface.

## Outbound network

CMOS makes outbound requests in exactly two situations, both optional:

1. **The dashboard, once you have a credential, or when you ask for it.** The URL resolves from
   `CMOS_DASHBOARD_URL`, then the baked `https://cmos.aquex.ai` default (`DEFAULT_DASHBOARD_URL` in
   [dashboard-client.ts](https://github.com/kneelinghorse/cmos-mcp/blob/main/src/tools/cmos/dashboard-client.ts)).
   - **Sign-in.** `cmos_auth(action="login")` or `login_init` contacts that host even when no URL
     variable or credential exists. `login_complete` polls only when given a `deviceCode`; without
     one it returns a local `MISSING_PARAMETER` and sends nothing.
   - **Registered-project writes and explicit completion calls start background uploads.**
     `cmos_session(action="complete")` and `cmos_sprint(action="complete")` start this best-effort
     work when a nonempty stored user-scoped key, `CMOS_DASHBOARD_API_KEY`, or the complete
     `CMOS_DASHBOARD_USER` / `CMOS_DASHBOARD_PASSWORD` pair exists. A project key alone does not
     open that gate. The primary path uploads a consistent snapshot of the **whole SQLite file**, including pending
     proposal drafts and any approval words already copied into decision records. It may first
     register the project and save its project key. Completion success does not confirm upload
     success: this work is asynchronous. For a registered project, an MCP tool call that actually
     writes the store also schedules an upload, due after 5 quiet minutes or 30 minutes of
     continuous writes. The next poll starts it within 60 seconds when no upload lease or failure
     backoff blocks it; transfer time is additional. A running server must have opened the
     project. An owed upload survives process exit in the per-user registry, and concurrent
     servers share one lease per project. Only explicit closes may register a new project.
     Upload results and failures appear in `cmos_status` and `cmos_review`; HTTP 401, 402 or 403
     pauses automatic retries until an explicit close succeeds. Without a project slug an explicit
     checkpoint can fall back to event replay;
     a registered project's failed file upload has no replay fallback in that cycle, and a later
     checkpoint retries. Implicit process-exit closes do not upload; explicitly completing an
     implicit session through the tool does. Set
     **`CMOS_CHECKPOINT_SYNC=off`** to disable these automatic upload paths
     (`triggerCheckpointBackfill` in [checkpoint-backfill.ts](https://github.com/kneelinghorse/cmos-mcp/blob/main/src/tools/cmos/checkpoint-backfill.ts)).
   - **Calls you make.** Messaging, status and sync health, `cmos_db` sync actions (backfill, pull,
     clone, purge), sprint carry-forward, and the onboard and review summaries of messages.
   - **Startup key recovery**, when a registered project and a usable user-scoped credential exist
     but the project's key is missing.
   - **Shared-store propagation.** Credentialed collab stores lock, pull and push around mission
     transitions, sprint status changes/completion, and project-identity name changes
     ([sync-locks.ts](https://github.com/kneelinghorse/cmos-mcp/blob/main/src/tools/cmos/sync-locks.ts)).
     `CMOS_CHECKPOINT_SYNC=off` does not disable this propagation or explicit sync calls.

   Without a credential, ordinary local work sends nothing: the baked address alone does not make
   any tool upload project data.

2. **HuggingFace (`huggingface.co`)**, only when the optional `@xenova/transformers` package is
   installed next to cmos-mcp. The default install does not include it, and then cmos-mcp never
   contacts HuggingFace: retrieval is keyword-only and `cmos_db(action="health")` reports semantic
   search off. With the package installed, the first write that records an embedding (a decision,
   learning or mission) or the first search downloads the embedding model
   `Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` (~25 MB, [embedding-pipeline.ts](https://github.com/kneelinghorse/cmos-mcp/blob/main/src/intelligence/embedding-pipeline.ts)),
   which is then cached locally. You can force **embedding-model loading to remain offline** with
   `CMOS_OFFLINE_EMBEDDINGS=1` (and optionally a pre-seeded `CMOS_MODEL_CACHE_DIR`): the loader sets
   `env.allowRemoteModels=false` before loading
   ([transformers-offline-env.ts](https://github.com/kneelinghorse/cmos-mcp/blob/main/src/intelligence/transformers-offline-env.ts)), and if the model is
   not present locally the vector arm degrades to keyword-only retrieval instead of blocking on a
   fetch (`getEmbedder` in [embedding-pipeline.ts](https://github.com/kneelinghorse/cmos-mcp/blob/main/src/intelligence/embedding-pipeline.ts)). The token
   counter's tokenizer (`Xenova/claude-tokenizer`) loads only when something counts tokens, and no
   tool does. A local-forever install never _hard-requires_ a network fetch.

## Authentication model

Dashboard authentication is **optional**. Device-code bootstrap uses the effective dashboard URL
described above and does not require an existing credential. After bootstrap, credential-bearing
project clients are constructed by `DashboardClient.fromEnvForProject()`
([dashboard-client.ts](https://github.com/kneelinghorse/cmos-mcp/blob/main/src/tools/cmos/dashboard-client.ts)); the selected credential source is
surfaced as an `authTier` (the `AuthTier` type and `deriveAuthTier` in
[auth-state.ts](https://github.com/kneelinghorse/cmos-mcp/blob/main/src/auth/auth-state.ts)):

- **`device-code` (preferred).** RFC 8628 device-code flow via `cmos_auth(action="login_init")` +
  `login_complete`. Mints user-scoped and project-scoped `cmk_` keys stored locally.
- **`legacy-env`.** A `CMOS_DASHBOARD_API_KEY` environment variable (`CMOS_DASHBOARD_API_KEY_ENV`
  in [dashboard-client.ts](https://github.com/kneelinghorse/cmos-mcp/blob/main/src/tools/cmos/dashboard-client.ts)). Kept as a CI/script fallback; the
  server emits a one-time `[WARN]` nudging migration to device-code (`warnLegacyAuth`, same file).
- **`password-fallback`.** Email + password login. Also emits the migration `[WARN]`.
- **`none`.** No stored credential — ordinary local work remains local and credential-requiring
  dashboard operations refuse gracefully. Credential bootstrap remains available: `login` /
  `login_init` require no existing key and may contact the baked dashboard host.

## Data & credentials at rest

- **Project data** lives in one SQLite file, `cmos/db/cmos.sqlite`, inside your project. It is not
  encrypted at rest (it is an ordinary SQLite database on your disk, with your filesystem's
  permissions).
- **Credentials** live at `<configDir>/credentials.json`, where `configDir` defaults to
  `~/.config/cmos-mcp` and honors `CMOS_CONFIG_DIR` (`CMOS_CONFIG_DIR_ENV` in
  [credential-store.ts](https://github.com/kneelinghorse/cmos-mcp/blob/main/src/intelligence/credential-store.ts)). The file is written atomically with
  **`0600`** permissions (`writeFileAtomic(…, { mode: 0o600 })`, same file).
- **The `cmk_` keys in that file are stored in plaintext** — there is **no** encryption at rest and
  we make no such claim (the key fields in
  [credential-store.ts](https://github.com/kneelinghorse/cmos-mcp/blob/main/src/intelligence/credential-store.ts) are documented "Plaintext `cmk_…`
  key"). The protection is filesystem permissions (`0600`), not cryptography. Treat
  `credentials.json` like an SSH private key.

## Backups & deletion — the honest reality

- **Database snapshots** are copies of the SQLite file under `cmos/db/snapshots/`.
  `cmos_db(action="snapshot")` takes one on demand. `cmos_sprint(action="complete")` attempts
  snapshots before and after closing; a snapshot failure warns without blocking the close.
  `cmos_db(action="prune_snapshots")` requires a backup before applying a nonempty selection.
  `cmos_db(action="restore")` requires a copy of the live database under
  `cmos/db/snapshots/pre-restore/` before replacing it. These are the automatic backup paths.
- **Retention deletes.** `CMOS_MAX_SNAPSHOTS` (default 50, `resolveMaxSnapshots` in
  [cmos-db-snapshot.ts](https://github.com/kneelinghorse/cmos-mcp/blob/main/src/tools/cmos/cmos-db-snapshot.ts)) caps how many snapshots are kept:
  taking one deletes the oldest beyond the cap, automatic ones included.
- The environment variables `CMOS_AUTO_SNAPSHOT`, `CMOS_SNAPSHOT_RETENTION_DAYS`, and `DB_PATH`
  appear in older docs but are **vestigial — no code reads them.** Do not rely on them.
- There is **no `deleted_at` soft-delete net** on the main store. Decisions and learnings carry a
  status (`active`/`superseded`/`archived`/`stale`), but `cmos_db(action="restore")` replaces the
  whole database, and `cmos_db(action="purge")` deletes this project's data from the dashboard
  mirror. A restore's pre-restore copy is **not listed or accepted by restore-by-ID**: keep its
  returned path for manual filesystem recovery with all writers stopped. That subdirectory is
  also outside the top-level snapshot retention count
  ([cmos-db-restore.ts](https://github.com/kneelinghorse/cmos-mcp/blob/main/src/tools/cmos/cmos-db-restore.ts)).
- **Snapshot content can be emptied.** `cmos_db(action="prune_snapshots")` is a dry run unless
  `confirm=true`; applied, it empties the content of context-snapshot copies CMOS wrote on its own
  (rows, ids, references and events stay) after taking a database snapshot.

## Untrusted / foreign content

Text that CMOS did not author locally — inbound message bodies and summaries, project directory
descriptions, and decision/learning rows synced from _other_ projects — is treated as **data, not
instructions**. It is rendered inside a source-labeled, self-escaping "untrusted" fence and carries an
additive `{source, trust:"foreign"}` descriptor
([provenance-frame.ts](https://github.com/kneelinghorse/cmos-mcp/blob/main/src/intelligence/provenance-frame.ts)), applied across the message list,
onboarding, directory, and cross-store/pull-merged decision & learning renders. The `cmos_message` and
`cmos_agent_onboard` tool descriptions state this contract to the calling agent.

- **Decision & learning read surfaces framed:** after a `cmos_db pull`, the local
  `strategic_decisions` / `learnings` tables can hold rows authored in another project. `project_id` is
  derived read-time (no migration; column-presence guarded so ancient stores degrade to `NULL` and
  render bare, never throw) and a foreign **decision or learning** row — its `project_id` ≠ the resolved
  local project — renders inside the untrusted fence, while local rows stay bare, at **every** surface
  that renders such rows:
  - the retrieval/search reads: mission-start "relevant decisions"
    ([relevance-surfacing.ts](https://github.com/kneelinghorse/cmos-mcp/blob/main/src/tools/cmos/relevance-surfacing.ts) →
    [cmos-mission-start.ts](https://github.com/kneelinghorse/cmos-mcp/blob/main/src/tools/cmos/cmos-mission-start.ts), decision text **and** evidence),
    `cmos_context(action="search")`, `cmos_decisions(action="search")`, `cmos_learnings(action="search")`
    (threaded through the retriever's `RankedResult` and the two direct-SELECT search paths);
  - the aggregate/digest reads: `cmos_context(action="view")` (full + compact),
    `cmos_agent_onboard` "Recent Decisions", and the `cmos_review` digest's recent-decisions.

  This closes the former mission-start "relevant decisions" limitation for decision/learning content.

- **MISSION / SPRINT / SESSION read surfaces framed:** the same pull-merge path
  stamps a foreign `project_id` onto pulled `missions` / `sprints` / `sessions` rows. Their
  name / objective / context / title / focus / summary fields are now derived read-time (same
  column-presence PRAGMA guard, so ancient stores degrade to `NULL` and render bare, never throw) and a
  foreign row — its `project_id` ≠ the resolved local project — renders inside the untrusted fence while
  local rows stay bare, at **every** surface that renders such rows:
  - `cmos_agent_onboard` current-sprint header, active-session, and pending & blocked missions;
  - `cmos_mission(action="list")` name/objective, `cmos_mission(action="show")` name/title/focus
    (inline) + objective/context/success_criteria/deliverables (block);
  - `cmos_mission(action="status")` local work-queue (In Progress/Current/Queued/Blocked names +
    objectives + sprint title/focus) and `acrossProjects=true` portfolio mission names (foreign fenced,
    the local project's own rows bare — the `[proj:X]` tag is metadata, not a trust boundary);
  - the `cmos_review` digest sprint title/focus, portfolio mission names, and the `Next:` recommendation
    (a foreign referenced mission renders **id-only** so its name never lands unfenced in the ≤4KB digest);
  - the `cmos_agent_onboard` **suggested actions** and the `cmos_review` promoted **next_actions** they
    feed — a foreign mission/session referenced by a "continue/start/resolve/complete" action renders
    **id-only** (name/title dropped) rather than fenced, keeping the byte-capped digest clean;
  - `cmos_session(action="list")` title/summary and `cmos_session(action="search")` title + matched
    snippets.

  This closes the former foreign MISSION/SPRINT/SESSION limitation; the decision/learning sweep above
  and this row-type sweep together frame every local-store read surface that can carry a pull-merged row.
  Scope boundary (ratified): the framed field set is name / objective / context / title / focus / summary
  (+ success_criteria / deliverables on `mission show`). Mission `notes` and `reference_docs` are **not**
  framed — they are operator-authored operational metadata (a blocker reason, a doc URI), rendered on a
  narrow set of surfaces, and were deliberately left out of the sweep; revisit if a real cross-owner share
  makes them an injection vector.

- The separate content sanitizer ([content-sanitizer.ts](https://github.com/kneelinghorse/cmos-mcp/blob/main/src/intelligence/content-sanitizer.ts))
  guards CMOS's own **write** paths against a specific tool-call-marshalling corruption; it is not the
  inbound-rendering mechanism above.

## Dependency posture

Since 3.2.0 a consumer install carries no embedding stack. Measured on packed tarballs installed with
`npm install --omit=dev` into an empty project: 3.1.0's install was 305.7 MB and `npm audit` reported
1 critical and 5 high advisories, all through `@xenova/transformers` (`protobufjs`, `onnx-proto`,
`onnxruntime-web`, `sharp`); the 3.2.0 release audit reported none. A fresh macOS arm64 install checked on 2026-10-09
uses 45,972 KiB under `node_modules` by `du -sk` (44.9 MiB); allocation varies by platform
and dependency resolution. `@xenova/transformers` is an
optional peer dependency. If you install it for semantic search, its chain carries those advisories
into your tree, and this package's `overrides` cannot reach a dependent's tree: pin `protobufjs` to
`^7` in your own `overrides`. In this repository the override still pins it for the development tree
(where the package is a dev dependency), guarded by
[tests/release/dependency-overrides.test.ts](https://github.com/kneelinghorse/cmos-mcp/blob/main/tests/release/dependency-overrides.test.ts).
For the 3.4.0 candidate on 2026-10-10, `npm audit --omit=dev --json` reported **zero** vulnerable
package entries. The full development installation's `npm audit --json` reported **40 affected
package entries: 9 moderate, 30 high and 1 critical**, counting `Object.keys(vulnerabilities)` and
the report's severity totals, including propagated dependency entries rather than distinct
advisories. These development-tree findings remain unresolved. The critical entry is
`handlebars@4.7.9` through the development dependency `ts-jest@29.4.6`; affected direct development
dependencies also include Jest, lint-staged, jest-cucumber and the optional embedding stack used
in development. This is not a clean full-tree audit. A consumer that installs the optional
embedding peer must audit that resulting installation separately.

## Sanctioned deployment shape

**Recommended: one project-local stdio server per project.** Launch CMOS from the project directory
(or let your MCP host advertise the project via `roots/list`) so attribution resolves to the right
project. Sender/attribution resolution never consults `CMOS_PROJECT_ROOT` at tool-dispatch time — that
env var is retained only as a bootstrap hint so the server can find its own `.env` (the module note
in [sender-context.ts](https://github.com/kneelinghorse/cmos-mcp/blob/main/src/intelligence/sender-context.ts)).

**The one topology to avoid:** a single _global_ MCP entry that pins `CMOS_PROJECT_ROOT` to one repo
while you work across several registered projects. That configuration ties `.env` bootstrap — and
any dashboard key that `.env` holds — to one repo that every sibling session shares. The server emits
a startup `[WARN]` when it detects exactly this — `CMOS_PROJECT_ROOT` pinned **and** more than one
project registered (`evaluateStartupTopology` in [index.ts](https://github.com/kneelinghorse/cmos-mcp/blob/main/src/index.ts)). If you see that warning,
prefer a project-local server or pass `projectRoot` explicitly per call.

**Credentials belong in `~/.config/cmos-mcp`, not a repo `.env`.** Keeping `cmk_` keys out of any
repository avoids committing or mirroring them. The publish/mirror tooling additionally fails hard if
a real `.env` (anything but `.env.template`) ever reaches the public tree (the leak guard in
[scripts/mirror-to-public.sh](https://github.com/kneelinghorse/cmos-mcp/blob/main/scripts/mirror-to-public.sh)).

### Read-only review agents (the review deployment)

CMOS ships a fail-closed **read-only mode** for agents that should never mutate your store — e.g. a
code-review agent. When `CMOS_AGENT_ROLE=review` is set, a dispatch-layer guard
([read-only-agent-guard.ts](https://github.com/kneelinghorse/cmos-mcp/blob/main/src/tools/cmos/read-only-agent-guard.ts), classifying every action via the
fail-closed [action-taxonomy.ts](https://github.com/kneelinghorse/cmos-mcp/blob/main/src/tools/cmos/action-taxonomy.ts)) hard-rejects every write-classified
tool call **before any database is opened** and is a strict no-op when the env is unset.

To close the _other_ data-loss vector — a review agent running `git reset`/`stash`/`clean`/etc. — the
repo ships a PreToolUse hook ([scripts/hooks/block-git-mutations.sh](https://github.com/kneelinghorse/cmos-mcp/blob/main/scripts/hooks/block-git-mutations.sh))
that rejects destructive git commands. It is **role-gated**: a strict no-op unless
`CMOS_AGENT_ROLE=review`, so it is safe to wire into any settings. To run a review deployment, use a
**separate** Claude Code / MCP host instance and apply
[scripts/hooks/review-agent.settings.json](https://github.com/kneelinghorse/cmos-mcp/blob/main/scripts/hooks/review-agent.settings.json) (copy it to that
instance's `.claude/settings.json`) — it sets `CMOS_AGENT_ROLE=review` and wires the hook, activating
both guards together.

**Reads never write the record, under any role.** Since 3.3.0 a read-classified call (the
`READ_ONLY_ACTIONS` list in [src/tools/cmos/action-taxonomy.ts](https://github.com/kneelinghorse/cmos-mcp/blob/main/src/tools/cmos/action-taxonomy.ts))
changes no row: no record status, no owner or address, no seeded identity, no schema label, no rebuilt
search index. Each repair that rewrites a value asks `callMayWrite()` in
[src/tools/cmos/tool-call-context.ts](https://github.com/kneelinghorse/cmos-mcp/blob/main/src/tools/cmos/tool-call-context.ts) first. Through 3.2.0 the
session opener marked old decisions and learnings `stale` on every review, the review role included. A
migration may still run on a read when it is DDL, the filling of a table or column that same call
added, and the new completion marker it writes under its own key when it ran that DDL
(`ensureExternalFts` and `ensureVectorStorage` in
[src/tools/cmos/schema-migrations.ts](https://github.com/kneelinghorse/cmos-mcp/blob/main/src/tools/cmos/schema-migrations.ts)). Store upkeep that
rewrites existing values (restoring rows an older CMOS marked stale, a pending master_context
migration, rebuilding a search index out of step with its table) runs only at a write, at a server
process's first write to a store (`runFirstWriteMaintenance` in
[src/tools/cmos/first-write-maintenance.ts](https://github.com/kneelinghorse/cmos-mcp/blob/main/src/tools/cmos/first-write-maintenance.ts)), and the
write's answer says what it did. A read that meets an index out of step says so on its answer, and the
server that read it rebuilds it at its next write. Repairs made on a write's way (an address heal, a
seeded identity row) are not that write (`asLazyRepair`): onboard, which makes no status write, never
starts the upkeep. Whoami and the startup lines write nothing at all; they resolve with the address the
next write would store. [tests/tools/cmos/reads-never-write.test.ts](https://github.com/kneelinghorse/cmos-mcp/blob/main/tests/tools/cmos/reads-never-write.test.ts)
calls every read-classified action against stores seeded so each old write was possible, in both
roles, and fails on any committed row change.

**Hook runtime files.** The hook CLI keeps per-machine state under the config directory, never in a
project or the store ([src/tools/cmos/harness-session.ts](https://github.com/kneelinghorse/cmos-mcp/blob/main/src/tools/cmos/harness-session.ts)):
`<configDir>/runtime/harness/<pid>.json` links a harness process to its sessions, each by a
16-character SHA-256 prefix of the session id (`harnessSessionHash`), and holds the path of the
folder the conversation works in; `<pid>.ended` holds the prefix of the session that ended;
`runtime/declined.json` lists repositories whose user declined the init offer;
and `runtime/fail-open.jsonl` records hook verbs that gave up (the verb and a cause, never content;
`recordFailOpen` in [src/cli/core.ts](https://github.com/kneelinghorse/cmos-mcp/blob/main/src/cli/core.ts)). No raw harness session id is written to the store, the
runtime files or a log. The hook verbs read the record without writing it (the digest is
`cmos_review`'s read), except that session end closes the sessions the conversation opened, and that
drafts are kept in the store's `proposals` table (below). No hook verb registers a project in the
project graph or writes its identity.

**Drafted records (3.3.0).** When an agent ends a reply with a `Would record:` line, the Stop hook
stores it in the store's `proposals` table: the line, its kind, the hashed session, up to 600
characters of the reply before it, the links it named, and whether the session had read outside
content. The prompt hook writes only a decline or a draft's first-offer time there. Neither is a
record: the table is outside search, embeddings and sync events, and nothing in it becomes a
decision, constraint, learning or profile line without a `cmos_decisions(action="record",
fromDraft=...)` call. The table is in `cmos.sqlite`, so a signed-in checkpoint upload carries it with
the rest of the store. The operator's reply to a draft is never written to the store by a hook.
The runtime uses one SQLite file per store under `<configDir>/runtime/drafts/`, keyed by a hash of
the project id and the store's native real path. It keeps:

- the newest 200 counted session-start times and each session's start time;
- offer counts per session and draft;
- the operator's reply, at most 1,000 characters, its class, the number of drafts it answered and
  the time it was received;
- the draft ids shown by the last reply, with their time;
- the draft ids in an approval window, its open/closed state and its time;
- transcript scan offsets and outside-content flags, keyed by hashes of transcript paths.

Session keys are 16-character hashes; raw session ids and transcript paths are not stored there
([src/tools/cmos/draft-runtime.ts](https://github.com/kneelinghorse/cmos-mcp/blob/main/src/tools/cmos/draft-runtime.ts)).
Replies, shown sets and windows stop being usable after two hours. That is an expiry check, not a
background deletion timer: cross-store pruning runs only at a session start inside a CMOS project
with a harness session id, visits at most 50 runtime files, and skips files it cannot open. Binding
a new reply also prunes expired replies in that store. A successful session-end cleanup deletes
that session's runtime rows; the bounded start-time history remains. A crash followed by no such
start or cleanup can leave expired data on disk. Only a `fromDraft` record copies a reply into the
decision it approves, as that decision's `approval_words`. Under `CMOS_AGENT_ROLE=review` session
starts do not prune or count toward draft expiry, and the hooks store, bind and decline nothing
([src/cli/drafts-hook.ts](https://github.com/kneelinghorse/cmos-mcp/blob/main/src/cli/drafts-hook.ts)).

The plugin also keeps hashed source-election and turn receipts under `runtime/hooks/`, and
completed first-prompt receipts plus delivered typed IDs under `runtime/recall/`. These receipts
survive session end so duplicate adapters or resumed conversations do not replay completed work.
Transient `runtime/lifecycle/` files hold the initial Git commit, dirty paths and compact marker;
successful session end removes only that conversation's transient files. Git summaries describe
repository observations, not agent authorship. The installer stores an exact runtime/version
marker with its package in `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA` and an installation pointer under the config
directory. `pluginServer: off` is checked before package discovery or installation and exposes
no tools or instructions. None of this external runtime state is uploaded with the project store.

**The operator profile.** `<configDir>/profile.md` holds the operator's working preferences, for
every project. It lives outside every repository and every store, so it is never committed and never
uploaded with the store. `cmos-mcp profile show` prints it. CMOS's own write path (`addProfileLine` in
[src/tools/cmos/operator-profile.ts](https://github.com/kneelinghorse/cmos-mcp/blob/main/src/tools/cmos/operator-profile.ts))
adds a line only on an approved draft of kind `profile`, refuses a line past the 1,100-character cap,
and never cuts the profile to fit. That is a rule CMOS keeps, not a sandbox: it checks the approval
it is handed, not where the approval came from, and the profile is an ordinary file in the user's
config folder, which anything running as the user, an agent with file access included, can edit.

**Honesty caveat (important).** The machine-enforced read-only guarantee holds under this
**separate-read-only-server** deployment, where the review agent's MCP server is launched with
`CMOS_AGENT_ROLE=review`. It does **not** automatically extend to in-session subagents spawned by a
normal build agent: those subagents share the parent's environment and MCP connection, so the parent's
(writable) server serves them. For read-only investigation _within_ a build session, use a read-only
subagent type (e.g. the `Explore` agent) — that is a mitigation, not the machine-hard guarantee.
