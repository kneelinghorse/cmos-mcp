## Unreleased

## 3.3.0 — 2026-10-09

This stable release includes the CLI, Claude Code plugin, digest, recall, feedback and local
measurements described in the development candidate below, plus proposal approvals and the
portable adapters listed here.

### Added

- **Portable harness adapters and MCP prompts.** Native hook files for Codex, Cursor, Devin,
  Copilot and VS Code Local share the installed CLI, with a dated coverage matrix and explicit
  live-verification limits in [the harness guide](docs/harnesses.md). The four MCP prompts
  `cmos-start`, `cmos-close-out`, `cmos-plan` and `cmos-build` read their corresponding skill
  sources; the plugin gains the read-only start skill. Foreign transcripts are not interpreted
  as Claude transcripts, and native adapters cannot inherit a parent Claude project's identity.
- **Proposals: agents draft, the operator approves.** An agent ends a reply that puts a choice to
  the operator with `Would record: <decision and reason>` (or `Would record (constraint|rule|profile): …`),
  up to three trailing lines. The silent Stop hook stores each as a draft (`P<n>`) in a new
  `proposals` table; the operator's next message binds only to the drafts that reply showed. A plain
  approval, nuance, a question, an amendment (a revised line replaces the draft) and a plain decline
  are read by published phrase lists. `cmos_decisions(action="record", content, fromDraft="P<n>")`
  records it, and the record says how the approval was known: `approved`, `agent-judged` (the
  operator's words attached) or `agent-attested`. Decision rows gain nullable `approval_mode`,
  `approval_draft` and `approval_words`. The record answer gains optional `approval` (draft, kind,
  mode, words), `answeredDrafts` and `stillPendingDrafts`; constraint, rule and profile drafts answer
  with `recorded` (kind, id, typedId, materialization) and are never recorded as agent-attested.
  New error codes: `DRAFT_NOT_FOUND`, `DRAFT_NOT_PENDING`, `APPROVAL_REQUIRED`. Drafts expire unanswered
  after 7 days or 3 session starts, flag outside content the session read, appear in the digest, and
  are listed by `cmos-mcp drafts list`; `stats` reports their outcomes and acceptance rate. The
  operator's words stay outside the store for at most two hours until a record copies them.

### Fixed

- Release E2E tests consume the existing build; implicit-session scenarios run the installed
  tarball. CI verifies the built server before running artifact consumers. The release scan
  rejects failed or empty tarball listings, and the public mirror compares exact Git paths,
  modes and objects before committing or tagging.
- Telemetry and recall identify a physical store by its native real path, so alternate path
  casing cannot split measurements or repeat same-session recall on case-insensitive disks.
  Prerelease files keyed from a differently cased path remain on disk; their opaque keys are
  not automatically reassigned, so old alias history may not appear in stable-version stats
  and first recall may replay once after upgrade. Draft approval state already uses native paths.
- Decision-timing statistics ignore undated completed missions with no linked decisions,
  because those missions cannot enter the measure. Undated missions with any linked decision
  still make timing unavailable; no historical timestamps are inferred or rewritten.

### Documentation corrections

- Measurement correction, checked 2026-10-09 on the published 3.2.0 package: an empty
  macOS arm64 install with `npm install --omit=dev @aquex/cmos-mcp@3.2.0` used 45,972 KiB
  under `node_modules` by `du -sk` (44.9 MiB). Earlier 44.7 MB and 44.9 MB labels below
  are corrected to that measured allocation and unit; this is not a portable install-size
  guarantee. The actual `tools/list` tool array has 19,523 JSON characters
  (`JSON.stringify(result.tools).length`, 15 tools), correcting the earlier 18,906 figure.
- The front door describes decisions that survive the session, includes a three-command first
  digest and plugin commands, and explains what leaves the machine. Onboard previews and selected
  list caps do not enforce a total response size: the earlier 28 KB claim was a fixture budget.
- The earlier 3.2.0 upload and snapshot descriptions were too broad. Successful explicit
  completion calls start a best-effort checkpoint, with a user-key or environment-credential
  gate; they do not guarantee an upload. Shared-store propagation is a separate path.
  Sprint backup failures warn, and restore's pre-restore copy requires manual recovery.
  [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) states the current contract and failure cases.

## 3.3.0-rc.1 — 2026-10-08

Prerelease published under the `next` dist-tag. Proposal drafts and the additional portable
adapters landed afterward in 3.3.0.

### Added

- **A Claude Code plugin and marketplace.** The canonical `plugins/cmos` subtree contains six
  skills, lifecycle hooks and an MCP server entrypoint. Hooks use a pinned package validated for
  the current platform, architecture and Node ABI; a detached installer publishes a complete
  native SQLite installation atomically. Hooks never invoke npx. Explicit commands and server
  startup may use the pinned npx fallback. `pluginServer: off` exposes an empty MCP surface even
  on a cold install without npm. Named hook sources elect one adapter per verified harness
  lifetime; real prompt IDs suppress successful repeated turn events. Missing IDs and
  unverifiable process lifetimes retain documented duplication limits. Compact reloads the
  digest; session end closes only an existing owned session and records bounded Git observations.
- **Later-prompt keyword recall.** After the first eligible prompt, hooks emit at most three
  unseen local decisions within 1,500 characters, requiring three whole-keyword matches. Seen
  state records complete delivered spans from recall and the digest. Short later prompts, slash
  commands and acknowledgements skip retrieval after telemetry. First-prompt policy is unchanged.
- **Standalone feedback and a read-only fleet view.** `cmos-mcp feedback --content <text>` files
  friction without a session or mission, with dry-run and JSON receipts; the package ships a
  feedback skill. `cmos_feedback(list, acrossProjects=true)` returns bounded newest rows with
  source-store provenance, full filtered counts, and explicit missing-store coverage. Additive
  result fields are `entries[].sourceProjectId`, `entries[].provenance`, and `fleet` with `complete`
  and per-store `projectId`, `totalCount`, `state`, and optional `error`. Sibling stores are never
  written by fleet reads; their dispositions are requested through authorized messages. Triage
  accepts `resolutionNote`. The shared digest includes open fleet feedback with a bounded read
  budget and marks unavailable coverage instead of presenting it as zero.
- **Digest v2 and first-prompt recall.** Session start, CLI review and MCP review share a stable
  local digest with the whole approved operator profile, binding rules, recent decisions and
  learnings, and open work within 4,000 characters. MCP keeps its bounded legacy structured result
  and appends portfolio context below the text pointer. Superseded choices are excluded. The first
  eligible prompt returns up to five decision previews using keyword retrieval and one hop of
  explicit local decision citations, without a vector model. External runtime state serializes
  delivery across processes and survives resume/compact; errors remain retryable. Typed item spans
  measure what actually survives output caps.
  The new `RecallResult`, `RecallItem` and `RecallVia` types are internal hook retrieval data;
  they do not add fields to MCP review's structured response.
- **Local usage measurements and `cmos-mcp stats`.** One best-effort record per MCP call or CLI
  invocation records typed IDs, counts, hashes and outcomes, never prompt text or record bodies.
  Measurements live outside repositories and SQLite under `<configDir>/telemetry/`, retaining the
  three newest monthly files per store; they are neither uploaded nor packed. Prompt hooks record
  procedure-pattern and rule-restatement matches before skips. `stats` reads these files and the
  store for G1 and sprint-close reports, states each counting rule, and marks missing evidence as
  unavailable. `stats --export` emits aggregate counts and ratios without local record details.
- **A command-line interface for hooks, inside the same bin.** `cmos-mcp` with no verb (or with
  `serve`) is still the MCP server, and `node dist/index.js` still starts it too. The verbs load only
  what they need, never the server:
  - `cmos-mcp hook session-start|prompt|stop|pre-compact|session-end` reads a harness hook's JSON on
    stdin. Session start injects the record's digest (Claude Code's
    `hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext`, at most 6,000 characters; `--format text` for plain text).
    Every hook verb exits 0, writes at most one stderr line (anything else written to stderr while it
    runs is held back), and prints nothing past its deadline, counted from process start (session
    start 3 s, prompt 0.8 s, stop 0.5 s, session end 1 s); stop, pre-compact and session end never
    print. A missing, locked or unreadable store gets that one line and a record in
    `<configDir>/runtime/fail-open.jsonl`, never an init offer. A word the CLI does not know is a
    usage error with exit 1 (exit 2 would block a prompt in Claude Code), never the MCP server.
  - `cmos-mcp review --format=context` prints the digest, and `cmos-mcp relevant --query <text>`
    prints matching decisions and learnings as previews, superseded rows dropped.
  - `cmos-mcp capture` and `cmos-mcp session ensure|close` write with `--session-id`; without one they
    refuse rather than open a session per process.
  - `cmos-mcp ambient on|off|digest-off` sets how present CMOS is in a project's sessions, and
    `CMOS_AMBIENT` overrides it for one session. In a git repository with no CMOS record, session
    start offers `/cmos:init` in one line; `cmos-mcp ambient off` there stops the offer.
- **One harness session is one CMOS session, in the conversation's own project.** Session start
  records which session a harness process is in (`<configDir>/runtime/harness/<pid>.json`, holding
  hashes of the session ids that process has had, never the ids, and the conversation's folder).
  The MCP server that harness started writes into that session, across a server restart and after
  `/clear`, whether it is the harness's direct child or runs through a launcher such as `npx` (it
  matches the session id it was spawned with). The session opens at the conversation's first write,
  so a conversation that never uses CMOS adds no row, and session end closes it. A server never
  closes it when it exits; it closes only the sessions it opened for itself. Writes to another
  project, and servers no hook links (Codex, editor extension hosts, Claude Desktop), keep a session
  per server process, as in 3.2.0. Hooks and the server must share `CMOS_CONFIG_DIR` (both default
  to `~/.config/cmos-mcp`).
- **One AGENTS.md for every new project.** `cmos_project(action="init")` and the new
  `cmos-mcp init` write the same AGENTS.md: the universal rules, about a dozen learned practices
  (probe before you encode, fix the class, no silent fail-open, tests never touch the network or
  live data, stay in your own repository, and more), trimmed placeholders, about 120 lines in all,
  and exactly one CMOS line naming the project's level and how to turn the hooks off. How to use
  CMOS arrives through its tools, hooks and tier guides instead. Init's CLAUDE.md now imports the
  agents file (`@AGENTS.md`) and names no tool prefix. The `--level` option of `cmos-mcp init`
  (ledger, planner or builder) answers the init question, and `--no-hooks` adds a labelled block
  of CMOS steps for a harness without hooks. The CMOS line follows the project: a level change
  (`cmos_project(action="update")`, or init run again with a level) and `cmos-mcp ambient` rewrite
  it in place, and a rules file without the line is left alone. Init says what it leaves undone:
  an existing CLAUDE.md that does not import the agents file, or a hook-less block it could not
  add.
- **The operator profile.** `<configDir>/profile.md` holds how the operator likes to work, for
  every project: outside every repository and store, so never uploaded. `cmos-mcp profile show`
  prints it. CMOS adds a line only from a draft the operator approved, refuses one past the
  1,100-character cap, and never cuts the profile to fit; the operator edits the file directly.

### Changed

- **An explicit session started inside a harness session belongs to that conversation.**
  `cmos_session(action="start")` records the harness session's key; the session absorbs only that
  conversation's writes, and session end (a `/clear` included) closes it. One started without a
  harness link stays keyless and absorbs every caller's writes, as in 3.2.0, so a server restart
  never orphans it. A write that names no session lands in the caller's own explicit session, else a
  keyless one, else the caller's implicit session. Another conversation's explicit session no longer
  blocks a start, and the refusal from one's own names the session to complete by id, as does
  onboard's "complete active session" command.
- **A new project is a Ledger by default.** With no level chosen, init stores the tier `general`
  (decisions and lessons) instead of `build`, unless the folder's AGENTS.md already names a level
  in its CMOS line (a team's committed file, or a store recreated beside it), which init keeps; its
  answer names the level and where it came from (`level` and `levelSource` on init's answer). A store that has no tier recorded still reads as
  `build`, as before. The tier guides now teach only calls the server accepts: the general guide
  opens with `cmos_review` and has no session ritual, the managed guide starts a cycle before
  adding tasks to it (each task names its id and cycle), and the build guide records decisions one
  way. Every `cmos_*(…)` example in the shipped seed now runs without a refusal.
- Onboard's "last session" is the most recent one, except that an automatic close that held nothing
  never displaces a handoff. The untagged-session advisory counts explicit sessions only.
- **Automatic session closes register nothing.** Reconcile, a server's exit and session end close
  sessions without registering the project, so a second checkout of a registered project no longer
  hits the registry's collision refusal on close. The registry's 5-second lock wait gives way to a
  hook's shorter one.

- **Reads never write the record.** Every read-classified call leaves the store as it found it, with
  or without `CMOS_AGENT_ROLE=review`. In 3.2.0, `cmos_review`, `cmos_agent_onboard` and
  `cmos_context(action="view")` marked old decisions and learnings `stale` on every call (the review
  role skipped only the view's copy); onboard resolved the owner through the dashboard and wrote it
  to metadata; every call, reads included, rewrote a `cmos://unknown/...` address; the view ran the
  master_context blob migration (a snapshot, a rewrite, and the event-column backfill); both searches
  raised the schema label, and rebuilt a search index that already existed (rewriting its completion
  marker); and a read, the identity view included, seeded a missing project_identity row. A
  migration may still run on a read when it is DDL, the filling of what that call added, and its own
  new marker row in a call that ran that DDL. A read that finds a search index out of step with its
  table says so on its answer ("Store upkeep"), since it may miss rows until a write rebuilds it.
- **Staleness is computed when read and never written.** Onboard, the review and the context view
  show the rows past the review age (20 sprints, as before) beside the rows stored as `stale`, with
  `cmos_decisions(action="review")` for each one's age and suggested action. The review now lists
  the learnings past the review age or marked stale too (`learnings` in its data, with their ages),
  and it is read-classified, so an agent under `CMOS_AGENT_ROLE=review` can run it. Onboard's `staleness`
  gains `dueForReviewDecisions` and `dueForReviewLearnings`. The clock counts Completed sprints and
  the open one, in any letter case; a Planned sprint no longer moves it, and the context view's
  `recentSprintCount` uses the same rule.
- **An explicit decision status update stamps `last_reviewed_at`** (update and batch_update), as the
  learnings update already did, including one that leaves the status as it was: keeping a decision
  `stale` on purpose is recorded as a review. Where the stamp cannot be written, an explicit `stale`
  is refused.
- **A server process's first write to a store restores the rows an older CMOS marked stale on its
  own**: a `stale` row in a `sprint-N` at least 10 sprints below the highest, with no evidence, not
  the target of a supersession, not evergreen, and never reviewed. It runs after a call that answered
  without error and changed a row in that store for its caller: never after a read, a report, a
  refusal or onboard (which makes no status write, feedback or not), and a repair made on a call's
  way (an address heal, a seeded identity row, the schema label) does not count as its write. It keeps
  a ledger in the store's metadata (`staleness_repair`, which also states what the repair cannot tell
  apart), the write's answer says what it restored under "Store upkeep", and `cmos_review` says when
  rows it restored are marked stale again with no review stamp, because only an older server writes
  that. Across copies of the 24 stores on the maintainer's machine it restores 453 of 457 stale rows
  and itemizes the 4 it leaves. The same first write migrates a pending master_context blob (a read
  shows the migrated shape without writing it) and rebuilds a search index a read found out of step
  or built before its completion marker; a server whose read found a gap after its first write
  rebuilds it at its next one.
- **Previews, not bodies**, in `cmos_decisions(action="search")`, `cmos_decisions(action="list")`,
  `cmos_learnings(action="list")`, `cmos_session(action="search")` and `cmos_session(action="list")`:
  each decision, learning, summary and capture is cut at 300 characters with `truncated` and
  `fullLength` (`summaryTruncated` and `summaryFullLength` for a session), and the answer says how to
  read one in full. `cmos_session(action="list", sessionId=...)` reads one session whole, its summary
  and every capture, in its text and its data (`captures`). A list never points `show` at another
  project's id. Next steps and constraints stay whole: each is the item an agent acts on, and no
  action reads one by id.
- **Compact mission receipts.** `cmos_mission(action="add")` names the stored fields in `fields`,
  and its `mission` keeps the mission's `id`, `name`, `sprintId` and `status` but no longer echoes
  the optional `objective`, `context`, `successCriteria`, `deliverables`, `referenceDocs`,
  `domainFields` and `notes`; `cmos_mission(action="show")` reads them. They were optional members of
  the receipt, so no published field is removed or renamed, but a caller that read them from add's
  answer now finds them absent. `update` adds `name` and `status`.
- **Every answer that touched a project names it** on its first line, however the project was
  chosen, an error answer from a call that resolved its project included.
- **Timestamps compare and sort as times** (`julianday()`) everywhere a stored timestamp is compared
  or ordered, in SQL and in TypeScript (a decisions list's order, search ties, the `since`/`until`
  filter over session-capture decisions, the backfill cursor, and every parse of a stored time for
  an age, a duration or a freshness lag), which reads SQLite's zone-less spelling as UTC as
  `julianday()` does. Mixed spellings (`T` and space separators, offsets,
  date-only values) used to compare as text: a session that went stale earlier the same day was not
  flagged until the date rolled over, and a list put #480 (`2026-06-30 03:10:21`) after #475
  (`2026-06-30T02:14:08.987Z`). A `since` or `until` of a year or a month (`2026-10`) covers that
  period, in every read that takes one (decisions list, learnings list, session search, context
  history and context update); one no stored time can be compared with is refused instead of
  matching nothing.
- **CMOS describes itself as the project's record, never its memory**, in the server instructions,
  the tool text, the general tier and the seed.

### Fixed

- **A re-init keeps the project's identity.** Running init again on an existing project minted a
  new project id and blanked its name, after which every write was refused as an identity
  conflict. Init now keeps the project's id (the store's own; for a store that was deleted and
  recreated while its `cmos/` folder stayed, the id the project registry holds for the folder) and
  its name, TraceLab link and
  level unless they are passed, and refuses a different project id before it writes anything. A
  new project in a folder a moved project left behind gets an id of its own. A new project's
  identity also names its real tier.

- `cmos_project(action="list")` never prunes: with `prune` it refuses and names `prune` and
  `validate`, which archive registry rows.
- `roots/list` is sent only to a client that declared the roots capability; a client that ignored it
  stalled the first CMOS call until the request timed out.
- `cmos_review` and onboard show a server running older code than its `dist/`: in the server's own
  checkout they name `scripts/restart-session-server.sh`, elsewhere they say to restart the MCP
  server, and the stale-server warning states the fact without a remedy of its own that could
  contradict that. whoami is prescribed only to a user who has the dashboard in their setup.
  whoami and the startup lines write nothing, from a call or from the command line: they resolve
  with the address the next write will store (so whoami's verdict on a send matches the send), and
  whoami says that repair is still to come.
- A brand-new project is not reported as drifting in the portfolio section.
- `cmos_project(action="init")` without `projectRoot` refuses with the call to make, and init in a
  temporary folder warns as `register` does.
- A failed learnings count at mission completion says so instead of reporting none recorded.
- Onboard (and so `cmos_review`) no longer fails when the dashboard's sync status carries no
  `tables`: the error escaped its catch, un-awaited. It answers without sync health and says so.
- The evergreen parameter's description says what it does now: the learning is never shown as past
  the review age.
- `cmos_sprint(action="list")` says how many Planned sprints a page left out.
- The shutdown lines on SIGINT and SIGTERM print only with `CMOS_DEBUG=1`.
- Onboard's text shows the tierSelectionPrompt its suggested action points at.

## 3.2.0 — 2026-10-07

Sprint 92 "Safe & Light": a stranger's first hour is safe and quiet, and no ceremony is destructive
by default. This is a **MINOR** release under this project's rule: no published receipt field is
removed or renamed. A 3.1.0 caller can observe four behaviour changes, each detailed below:

- **Every answer names its project.** `projectRoot` and `resolvedBy` are on every response's data. A
  call from a folder that is not a CMOS project is refused instead of routed to the one registered
  project.
- **A capture never fails for lack of a session.** With none open, it lands in the calling process's
  implicit session, which the server closes when the process ends.
- **A registry default set before 3.2.0 must be re-confirmed** with
  `cmos_project(action="register", projectRoot=…, setAsDefault=true)` before it is applied.
- **Sprint close no longer archives decisions and learnings by default.** `archive: true` opts in,
  with the itemized receipt.

Install and audit, measured on the packed tree installed with `npm install --omit=dev` into an empty
project: 44.9 MiB on disk across 138 production dependencies (3.1.0: 305.7 MB), and
`npm audit --omit=dev` reports no vulnerabilities (3.1.0: 1 critical and 5 high, all through the
embedding stack, now an optional peer). The tarball is 1.19 MB, 5.17 MB unpacked.

### Changed

- **A call never acts on a project the caller did not name.** With exactly one registered project,
  3.1.0 answered every folder with that project: a decision and a session recorded from an
  uninitialised folder B were written into project A. That registry-singleton step is gone for reads
  and writes. Resolution now selects one store by detection — the explicit `projectRoot`, then the
  first MCP root inside a CMOS project, then the working directory or the nearest folder above it
  that is a CMOS project (one holding `cmos/db/`; a plain folder named `cmos`, such as a source
  module, does not count) — and the selected store is final: when it cannot be used, the call is
  refused instead of falling through to another project. **Consequences a 3.1.0 caller can
  observe:**
  - `projectRoot` naming a folder that is not a CMOS project is refused (`CMOS_NOT_DETECTED`); 3.1.0
    fell through and acted on the cwd project. A folder inside a project is refused with the
    enclosing project's path as the remedy.
  - A call from a folder that is not a CMOS project is refused: a write names
    `cmos_project(action="init", projectRoot=…)`, a read answers "No CMOS project in '<dir>'".
  - A working directory, or an advertised MCP root, inside a project now resolves to that project
    (the walk-up stops below `$HOME`). 3.1.0 only looked at the folder itself.
  - When the client advertised roots that hold no CMOS project and the working directory answered
    instead, the answer says so in one rendered line.
  - `cmos_message(action="send")` from the server's own install directory resolves to the store
    there; the 3.1.0 cwd-vs-install-root guard is retired.
  - A registry default applies only to a call with no project context at all (no `projectRoot`, no
    MCP roots, and a working directory of `/`, `$HOME` or the install directory), and only once
    confirmed with `cmos_project(action="register", projectRoot=…, setAsDefault=true)`. **A default
    set before this release is not applied until re-confirmed**; the startup log,
    `cmos_message(action="whoami")` and `cmos_review` say so.
  - `cmos_project(action="unregister")` takes its path literally: a path that is no longer a CMOS
    project is unregistered by path, and no longer unregisters the cwd project instead.
    `cmos_project` list/validate/prune/sweep and the user-level `cmos_auth` actions no longer need a
    resolvable project.
- **`cmos_message` validates an explicit `projectRoot` on every action.** list, get, respond, ack and
  directory used to pass it through unchecked; a folder that is not a CMOS project is now refused.
- **`SenderResolutionSource`** (`whoami`'s `resolved.source`, candidate traces) loses
  `registry-singleton` and gains `server-project-root` and `registry-default`.
  **`ProjectValidationItem.status`** gains `ephemeral`.

- **The next-step lease counts real closes, within the operator's calendar bounds.** In 3.1.0,
  `cmos_sprint(action="complete")` kept a sprint's planned end date (`COALESCE(end_date, ?)`), and the
  lease counts a close by `end_date` — so a sprint planned for next week but closed today counted as a
  close every row carried after it had survived. TraceLab lost 58 freshly carried rows that way.
  - A close now stamps its **actual close time** into `end_date`; the receipt reports the planned date
    as `plannedEndDate`. `cmos_sprint(action="update", fields: {status: "Completed"})` — the close by
    status update some projects use — stamps it too (`endDateStamped`, `plannedEndDate`), unless the
    same update sets `endDate`; a future `endDate` is honoured with a warning.
  - The lease ignores any `end_date` still in the future.
  - **One-time repair, at the first close after upgrading:** Completed sprints whose `end_date` is later
    than their recorded close (the `sprint_complete` event, else its context snapshot) are re-dated to
    it. The close receipt's `endDateRepair` lists each re-dated sprint (`from` → `to`) and every
    Completed sprint left as found because nothing records when it closed. Only later dates move, so a
    correctly dated store sees no lease change. Measured: 9 sprints on a TraceLab copy, 1 here.
  - **Calendar bounds (operator decision #1161):** no row is dropped before it is 14 days past its last
    carry or creation, however many closes it survived (the close receipt lists such rows under
    `heldByMinAge`); a row that has survived no close for 6 weeks is flagged `idle` — in the
    next-steps list, the close receipt and the opener's next actions — and is never dropped by the
    calendar alone. `LeaseState` gains `idle`; the published counting rule says all of this.
- **A sprint close no longer archives the sprint's decisions and learnings** (operator decision
  #1160). Through 3.1.0, `cmos_sprint(action="complete")` archived every active decision and learning
  bound to the closing sprint. Across the fleet 78% of decisions ended up archived, mostly by that
  step, and projects worked around it by closing sprints with a status update or recording
  corrections without a sprint. They now stay active; a decision still leaves the active set when a
  new row supersedes it.
  - `archive: true` opts back in and reproduces the old step exactly: the same rows, evergreen
    learnings kept active, every archived id named. Measured on identical copies of this repo's
    store: the pre-change close and `archive: true` archived the same 12 decisions and 2 learnings
    and rendered the same receipt line.
  - The receipt's `lifecycle` gains `archived`, true only when `archive: true` was passed. By default
    `decisionsArchived` and `learningsArchived` read 0 and `archivedDecisionIds` and `learningIds`
    read `[]`; all four stay in the receipt.
  - The pre-close database snapshot is still taken: the close still writes the end date and the
    lease drops.
- **A capture never fails for lack of a session.** In 3.1.0, `cmos_session(action="capture")` with
  no session open was refused with `SESSION_NOT_ACTIVE`. Neither `cmos_review` nor
  `cmos_agent_onboard` opens a session, so the first capture of most conversations failed. Since
  3.2.0 a capture, a `cmos_decisions` record, or a mission completion with `decisions[]` that names
  no session lands in the caller's session. That is the project's open explicit session when one
  exists, as before. Otherwise it is the calling process's own **implicit session**, opened on first
  use.
  - **Attribution is per process.** Each server process writes under its own implicit session, and
    no call writes into another process's. Naming another live process's implicit session on
    `capture` is refused however idle that session is (`INVALID_PARAMETER` on `sessionId`). On
    `complete` it is refused until the session has been idle for more than 12 hours. A recorded
    decision is now attributed to the caller's session, where 3.1.0 left `author_session_id` NULL
    when no session was open. One limit: on a store that pulls collaborators' sessions through
    collab sync, a pulled active session counts as the project's explicit session, as it did in
    3.1.0.
  - **Who closes them.** The server closes its implicit sessions when its client goes away (stdin
    end, SIGINT, SIGTERM). A process's first write to a store, of any kind, also closes implicit
    sessions there whose process is gone from this host, or that have been idle for more than 12
    hours. Each carries a deterministic summary and is listed under `closedSessions` on a capture,
    record or start, or as a warning line on a mission completion. These closes call the session
    handler directly and **never upload a checkpoint**.
  - **Sprint tagging.** An implicit session carries no sprint. Every row it writes resolves its
    sprint when it is written, as any untagged write does, instead of inheriting the sprint that was
    open when its process started.
  - **Explicit sessions** keep one-at-a-time per project, and implicit sessions never block a start.
    A start first closes an explicit session idle for more than 12 hours, and lists it under
    `closedSessions`. A start refused by a live session closes nothing.
  - Orphan detection, the cross-project sweep and the onboard active session list explicit sessions
    only.
  - `sessions` gains `implicit` and `owner_key`, added by a one-time migration. `owner_key` stores a
    hash of the hostname, never the name.

- **Retrieval answers carry previews, not bodies.** Hits in `cmos_context(action="search")` and
  `cmos_learnings(action="search")`, and the decisions `cmos_mission_transition(action="start")`
  surfaces, now carry a preview of at most 300 characters. Each one keeps its id and gains `status`,
  `truncated` and `fullLength`. The fields keep their names (`text`, `content`, `decisionText`), so
  a caller that read the full text from them now reads the preview; the full text comes from the new
  `show` actions. Measured on a fixture of 2,000-character rows, a 10-hit search answer went from
  24,796 characters to 7,226. Rows are still scored on their full text.
- **`tools/list` is about half the size.** The descriptions clients receive are short:
  19,523 characters, about 4,881 tokens, where they were 38,141. The schemas are unchanged, and
  TOOL_REFERENCE.md keeps every full description. A test holds the list under 6,000 tokens at four
  characters a token.
- **Completing a mission counts the decisions it recorded.** The recommended path records each
  decision with `cmos_decisions(action="record", missionId)` and then completes the mission. 3.1.0
  counted only the completion call's own `decisions[]`, so that path was told "No decisions captured
  for this mission" — the most reported pain since 3.1.0. The advice now fires only when the mission
  has no non-superseded decision at all, counting rows recorded at any time: before the mission
  started, and on missions with no recorded start. The receipt gains `missionDecisionCount` and
  renders "Decisions recorded for this mission: N"; `decisionCount` still counts this call's own
  inserts.
- **No more automatic supersession offers or implicit reaffirms.** A captured or recorded decision
  used to come back with `supersessionCandidates` and a `supersessionMessage`, and a capture bumped
  `last_reviewed_at` on any learning whose text it resembled (`implicitlyReaffirmedLearningIds`).
  Replayed over every historical capture, 69 of 9,035 offers were true, and 20 of 3,973 implicit
  bumps touched a learning the author cited. Both are retired. The three fields stay in the answer
  types, deprecated and never populated. Explicit paths are unchanged: `supersedes=[…]` on record,
  `citesLearningIds`, and `cmos_learnings(action="reaffirm")`.
- **The opener tells the truth.** On a fresh project, `cmos_review`'s top next actions used to be a
  pointer to a `tierSelectionPrompt` the digest does not carry, a whoami nudge, and a dashboard login
  nag. Now:
  - The review never forwards an action that points into onboard's own payload. On a fresh project
    it leads with `cmos_agent_onboard()`.
  - Whoami is prescribed only when the project was inferred rather than named. An explicit
    `projectRoot`, the client's MCP roots and the server's `--project-root` all name it, and the
    review now passes the client's roots through.
  - The login nag and the "messaging block omitted" warning appear only after the user opts into the
    dashboard: a stored credential, a legacy env credential, or an explicit `CMOS_DASHBOARD_URL`. The
    built-in default URL is not a choice the user made.
  - "Start a planning or review session" is retired, since a session is optional.
  - The digest gains `recentLearnings`: up to three, trimmed before any decision when its 4 KB budget
    binds. Decisions and learnings carry their ids, in the data and on each rendered line.
- **`cmos_agent_onboard` is bounded, and says so.** It claimed "<4KB" and measured 36,142 bytes on
  this repository's store. Recent decisions are now 300-character previews with `id`, `truncated` and
  `fullLength`. Open items and the top-level next steps are previews too. The last session's summary
  is capped at 1,000 characters, and its decisions and next steps at the newest five previews (the
  full session is on `cmos_session(action="list")`). The same store now measures about 21,000
  characters, and a test holds a long-history fixture under the documented 28,000.
- **Search finds archived decisions, and fills its page.** In 3.1.0, `cmos_context(action="search")`
  and mission-start surfacing returned active rows only, but a sprint close archived decisions: 46%
  of the rows later records cite were no longer active when cited. The filter also ran after the
  candidate pool was cut, so 26-33% of searches came back short; one returned a single row for
  `limit 5`.
  - Both surfaces now drop only superseded rows, and each hit shows its status: search labels each
    hit `decision #N, archived`, and mission start marks its bullets the same way. An explicit
    `statusFilter` keeps its include-list meaning (`["active"]` restores the old behaviour), and
    `[]` still disables the filter.
  - The search answer's `options` gains `excludedStatuses`: `["superseded"]` when the caller named no
    statuses. `statusFilter` then reads `[]`, where 3.1.0 reported `["active"]`.
  - The filter runs inside the candidate queries, so a page is never short because the pool was cut
    first.
  - The keyword arm reads every distinct query keyword, up to 64, where it read the first 10.
  - Measured on 2,154 natural citation labels in four stores, with no embedding package installed:
    recall@10 went from 0.331 to 0.638, mission-start recall@5 from 0.149 to 0.429, and short pages
    from 54.8% to 0% (`cmos/docs/s92-m07-retrieval-evaluation.md`).
- **The embedding stack is an optional peer dependency.** `@xenova/transformers` is no longer
  installed with cmos-mcp. On the same labels, keyword-only retrieval beats the old equal-weight
  hybrid, and the stack was most of the install.
  - Measured on packed tarballs installed with `npm install --omit=dev`: 305.7 MB → 44.9 MiB, and
    `npm audit` went from 1 critical and 5 high advisories (all through `@xenova/transformers`:
    protobufjs, onnx-proto, onnxruntime-web, sharp) to none.
  - Without the package, writes record no embedding and searches are keyword-only, both silently,
    and nothing contacts HuggingFace. To keep semantic search, install `@xenova/transformers` next to
    cmos-mcp; the vector term then counts 0.25 in the fusion (it counted 1.0).
- **A normal start writes two stderr lines**: the version, and the project a call with no context
  would use. A clean-room 3.1.0 start wrote 16. Startup and per-call diagnostics (the `.env` loader,
  attribution self-test, registry, health, MCP roots probe) are behind `CMOS_DEBUG=1`. Real
  misconfigurations still print.
- **Launch recipes pin the version.** README and getting-started recommend
  `npm install -g @aquex/cmos-mcp@3.2.0`, or `npx --prefer-offline -y @aquex/cmos-mcp@3.2.0` in every
  client config. An unpinned `npx -y` could look the package up again on every launch and silently
  move to the latest release.

- **Session and mission closes stop storing snapshot content.** The copy a close writes after
  persisting its context is now content-less: its row is written with `content` empty,
  `content_pruned_at` stamped and its hash prefixed `pruned:`, so it is never a dedup hit, and
  `cmos_context(action="history")` marks it `contentPruned`. These copies were 282.7 MB of the
  367.6 MB of snapshot content on the 24 stores measured, and no query reads them; the context row
  holds the same content. Sprint milestones, explicit snapshots, update and auto-refresh copies, and
  every recovery copy taken before a trim, condense or migration keep their content.
  - When the context write fails, the copy keeps its content as the only durable copy, and its
    source ends `:only_copy` so no prune reclaims it.
  - A session close no longer overwrites a context it cannot read or parse. It leaves it as it is
    and reports a `CONTEXT_UNREADABLE` write failure.
  - Retention archives now carry the source `retention_archive:<caller source>`, so a session
    close's archive no longer shares its source string with that close's content-less copy.
- **A snapshot no longer stands on a row a prune would reclaim sooner.** Every snapshot site skips
  writing when a row of the same context already holds identical content. A milestone, a named
  snapshot or a recovery copy now does so only when that row is never pruned, so its own retention
  holds. A recovery copy is kept 30 days from its own creation, so it may also stand on an identical
  recovery copy under a minute old: a retried migration still writes one row. Before, a named
  snapshot, a sprint-close milestone or a condense backup taken just after an update returned the
  update copy's id under the copy's source, and on this repository's store 67 of 70 recorded sprint
  closes left no milestone row of their own. `cmos_context(action="snapshot")` now refuses a source
  that reads as one of CMOS's automatic copies (`Context update:`, `session_complete:`,
  `context_condense:` and the like).
- **The sprint-close growth advisory counts only snapshots that still hold content**, so it clears
  once a prune has run (the prune keeps every row), and it names
  `cmos_db(action="prune_snapshots")`.
- **`cmos_project(action="init")` writes `AGENTS.md`** at the project root, the file many coding
  agents read, unless an agents file of any case is already there; an existing `agents.md` is left
  as it is. The seed template now ships as `cmos-seed/templates/AGENTS.md`, and the CLAUDE.md init
  writes points at whichever agents file the project has.
- **Node.js 20 or newer.** `engines` now says `>=20`, which is what `better-sqlite3` 12 needs; the
  docs said 18.
- **`cmos_review` no longer prescribes missions to a general-tier project.** With no missions, its
  answer leaves out the work-queue and `Next:` lines, and `workQueue.nextAction` reads "Nothing in
  progress." Other tiers are unchanged.

### Removed

- **`fast-xml-parser`**, a runtime dependency nothing imported.

### Fixed

- **`acrossProjects=true` no longer redirects a write.** `cmos_mission`, `cmos_decisions` and
  `cmos_learnings` skipped project resolution whenever the flag was set, on every action — so
  `cmos_decisions(action="record", projectRoot=B, acrossProjects=true)` dropped `B` and wrote the
  working directory's project. Only the three portfolio reads (`cmos_mission` status, `cmos_decisions`
  list, `cmos_learnings` list) skip the local requirement now; every other action resolves normally.
- **The docs are true for a stranger.** Each item was re-checked against the code:
  - Snapshots: README, SECURITY.md and getting-started now say the same thing. `cmos_db` takes a
    snapshot on demand, and CMOS takes one before and after every sprint close and before a
    snapshot prune applies; restore copies the live database aside first. They used to say backups
    were manual only, or that nothing snapshots before a destructive step.
  - SECURITY.md states that once any dashboard credential exists, every session or sprint close
    uploads the entire SQLite file, and documents `CMOS_CHECKPOINT_SYNC=off`, now also in README's
    environment block.
  - `cmos_message`'s full description no longer says it requires password environment variables; it
    names the device-code sign-in. `maxSnapshots` is described as the retention cap it is.
  - `DASHBOARD_NOT_CONFIGURED` means there is no sign-in. Its suggestion, README and the
    troubleshooting guide no longer blame an empty `CMOS_DASHBOARD_URL`, which has a default.
  - getting-started: `cmos_project(action="register")` records the project locally; the first close
    after you sign in registers it on the dashboard. The no-network claim says when it holds, and the
    loop opens with `cmos_review`.
  - README's first call starts with `cmos_project(action="init")`; onboard refuses without a
    database like every other tool.
  - SECURITY.md cites source by repository link and symbol name instead of line numbers that drifted
    and were dead links in the npm package.
- **No internal references in published text.** Tool descriptions, TOOL_REFERENCE.md, SECURITY.md
  and the seed schema every project receives no longer cite this repository's sprint, mission,
  decision or issue numbers, and a test keeps them out. Runtime messages that cited them (the
  `CMOS_PROJECT_ROOT` warnings, a pull warning, the untagged-decision advisory) say what they mean
  instead.

### Added

- **`cmos_db(action="prune_snapshots")`**, a supported prune for old context snapshots, requested by
  Stage1 (1,192 snapshots, 49.2 MB, and no safe way to remove them).
  - It is a dry run unless `confirm=true`. The dry run reports counts and bytes per context and why
    each kept snapshot is kept.
  - Applying takes a database snapshot first and stops if that fails. It then empties content in one
    transaction and never deletes a row, so ids, foreign keys and `snapshot_taken` events survive and
    a pull or backfill has nothing to restore.
  - It reclaims only copies the server wrote on its own (close copies, including legacy
    `session_runtime`/`mission_runtime` rows, update copies, and recovery copies older than 30 days).
    It always keeps:
    - the newest and last `keepLast` (default 30) per context, counting only snapshots that still
      hold content;
    - every snapshot a decision or a context's `archived_sprint_summaries` references;
    - sprint milestones, and the state each sprint close landed on when that close stored no
      milestone of its own. The answer counts closes as recorded (an event, or the close's own
      milestone row) or approximate (only an end_date), and counts Completed sprints with neither;
    - snapshots someone named;
    - the caller's `keepIds`, `keepSince` and `keepSources` (`*` patterns).
  - It refuses to apply while a decision column, a context, the event log or the sprints table
    cannot be read, since a reference or a sprint close there could not be honoured. It re-reads
    and re-selects under the write lock, and empties only rows the database snapshot holds.
  - The applied answer reports the content emptied, counted row by row per context and in total,
    and the content left.
  - A retention archive is kept while a context's `archived_sprint_summaries` names it. Once a
    re-archive, an aggressive condense or the 100-summary cap drops that entry, it is an ordinary
    recovery copy and is reclaimed once it is 30 days old.
- **`cmos_db(action="health")` reports `semanticSearch`**: whether the vector term can take part
  (`loaded`, `installed`, `not-installed` or `failed`) and why, without loading anything.
- **`CMOS_DEBUG=1`** brings back every startup and per-call diagnostic on stderr.
- **Server instructions.** `initialize` now returns instructions every MCP client can use without a
  rules file. The first 512 characters state the loop on their own: open with `cmos_review`, record
  a decision with `cmos_decisions(action="record")`, never edit one (supersede it), and pass
  `projectRoot` outside the project folder.
- **`cmos_decisions(action="show", decisionId)` and `cmos_learnings(action="show", learningId)`**
  read one row in full by id, the way to expand a preview. An id the project does not hold is
  refused by name (`INVALID_PARAMETER`).
- **An explicit `sprintId` on `cmos_session` start and capture.** It names an existing sprint of any
  status, for example a planned sprint for a planning session. A sprint that does not exist is
  refused by name (`SPRINT_NOT_FOUND`). On capture it tags the rows the capture writes, including
  the next-steps and constraints materialized at the session's close. A mission's sprint still wins
  when `missionId` is given, and since this release it decides those deferred rows too, where 3.1.0
  gave them the session's sprint.
- **Every success payload names the store it touched**: `data.projectRoot` and `data.resolvedBy`
  (`explicit`, `mcp-roots`, `cwd`, `server-project-root`, `registry-default`, or `none` with a null
  `projectRoot` for a portfolio, registry or dashboard-only call), plus one rendered line
  ("Project: <root> (resolved by …)") whenever `resolvedBy` is not `explicit` or `cwd`.
  `cmos_review` carries both fields inside its 4 KB digest budget.
- **`--project-root <dir>`**, a server argument for one MCP config: the project used by calls that
  carry no project context. This is the Claude Desktop recipe — local to that config, unlike a
  machine-global default.
- **Ephemeral stores.** `cmos_project(action="register")` returns `ephemeral` (with a warning) for a
  store under the OS temp directory, `/tmp`, `/private/tmp`, or a path in the new
  `CMOS_EPHEMERAL_PATHS` variable; `validate` reports them as `ephemeral`, and `validate` with
  `prune=true` archives them even while the store exists. Registry rows gain `defaultApplied`
  (`register`, `list`); `whoami` gains `registryDefault` and `serverProjectRoot`; `cmos_review`
  gains `registryDefault` when a default exists but is not applied.

### Internal

- **A test run can no longer rewrite the real build manifest.** The manifest generator takes
  `--dist <dir>`, its tests run the real script against a temporary directory, and the suite's
  global teardown fails the run if `dist/.build-manifest.json` changed. The server reads that file to
  report a stale build, so a full run used to make a running server think it was stale.
- **The unit suite denies outbound network.** A connection to any host that is not loopback fails,
  and fails the test that made it even when the code swallowed the error; a test opts in per origin
  with `allowNetworkOrigins`. A nested-jest test proves the failure is loud.
- **The packed-tarball E2E lane runs the clean-room scenarios** against the installed package: no
  write lands in another project from an unrelated folder or an explicit non-project root, a fresh
  project's opener carries nothing misleading, record → start → complete counts the decision, and
  `tools/list` stays under its ceiling. The publish workflow now runs the lane before it publishes.
- The session-capture tests drive the shipped handler instead of a private copy of an older one.
- The first test of the server-runtime suite no longer pays the module-compile cost under load; a
  warm-up does, under its own timeout.
- The Last Updated provenance oracle follows a renamed file across an older merge when every such
  merge predates the latest body change it found.

## 3.1.0 — 2026-09-18

Sprint 91 "What the Field Said". Fifteen days of field use of 3.0.0 reported that the write surface
still dropped data silently at the boundary an adopter touches first, and that a decision's
lifecycle status stood in for whether it was still true. This release fixes the first and encodes
the operator's three-lifecycle policy for the second. It is a **MINOR** release under this project's
rule: no published receipt field is removed or renamed. Every receipt change is additive, and
supersession candidates keep `decisionText` with a bounded value. Two behaviour changes are
disclosed under Changed with their consequence, because a caller of 3.0.0 can observe them:
undeclared top-level parameters are now refused, and a sprint close drops next-steps whose lease
lapsed.

### Added

- **`cmos_decisions(action="record")` writes a decision without a session, and supersedes what it
  corrects in the same call.** Parameters: `content` (required), `missionId`, `sprintId`,
  `supersedes` (decision ids), `evidence`, `citesLearningIds`, `domain`. The row's sprint is the
  mission's sprint when `missionId` is given, else an existing `sprintId`, else the open sprint, else
  `null` (disclosed as a warning). Each `supersedes` id must exist and is set
  `status='superseded', superseded_by=<new id>` in the same transaction as the INSERT; the receipt
  echoes `previousStatus → newStatus` per target. A retry with identical text by the same author
  returns the existing row (`materialization: "existing"`) instead of writing a second one. This is
  the recovery path for decisions lost on `cmos_mission_transition(action="complete")`: record them
  with `missionId` after the mission has completed. Decision text is never amended in place; a
  correction is a new row that names what it supersedes.

### Changed

- **Unknown top-level parameters are refused before dispatch; update refusals name the `fields`
  wrapper.** Every published tool schema has declared `additionalProperties: false` since it was
  published, and nothing enforced it: a misplaced key was dropped silently and the call succeeded
  without it. A call carrying a key its tool does not declare now returns `INVALID_PARAMETER` with
  `field` set to that key, after the existing action and `projectRoot` checks and before any store
  is opened; when the key belongs to a nested object on the same tool, the suggestion names it (for
  example `metadata` → `fields` on `cmos_mission(update)`). **Consequence:** a caller that sends an
  undeclared key and received a success on 3.0.0 receives a refusal on this release. Inside
  `fields`, `cmos_mission(update)` and `cmos_sprint(update)` refuse an unknown key by name instead of
  skipping it while reporting it in `updatedFields` — and an all-unknown `fields` object no longer
  executes an empty `UPDATE` that failed with `DB_QUERY_FAILED` and the advice "Check the SQL syntax".
  The no-fields refusal now says `fields: { ... }` and that a bare top-level `notes`/`status` is not
  read.
- **Mission and session completion refuse to transition when a sibling array was absorbed into a
  free-text field.** When a host drops a closing tag, `decisions=[...]` (or `agentFeedback`, or for
  sessions `nextSteps`) lands inside `notes`/`summary` as a literal `<parameter name="…">` token;
  the sanitizer strips it and the parameter arrives empty. The server used to complete the mission
  anyway, report "no decisions captured", and answer a retry with "No action needed". It now
  refuses with `INVALID_PARAMETER` (`field` = the lost parameter) before the transition, so the
  mission or session stays open, and names the retry plus `cmos_decisions(action="record")`. An
  absorbed tag that names no missing sibling completes as before with `sanitizedFields`. An
  already-Completed retry that carries `decisions` or `agentFeedback` now names the record remedy.
  The build tier guide, getting-started guide, and build-session prompt now teach notes-only
  completion with a separate `record` per decision.
- **Sprint close drops next-steps whose lease lapsed; the survey includes carried rows and per-row
  age.** A next-step now holds a lease. Its age is the number of sprint closes it has survived:
  Completed sprints with a recorded `end_date` later than its last carry (or, if never carried, its
  creation). The closing sprint never counts toward its own close. At 3 the row is warned; at 4,
  unless carried in between, `cmos_sprint(action="complete")` sets it `dropped` inside the close
  transaction and lists it in the new `lapsedDroppedIds`, with the exact
  `cmos_context(action="next_steps", nextStepAction="reopen", nextStepIds=[...])` undo printed
  beside it. Carrying renews the lease; reopening restarts it from creation. The close still never
  writes `completed`. `nextStepsSurvey` now covers pending **and carried** rows and gains
  `totalOpen` and a `lease` block (thresholds, counting rule, warned and lapsed ids); `totalPending`
  keeps its meaning. `cmos_context(action="next_steps", nextStepAction="list")` with no status now
  lists every open row with `closesSurvived` and `lease`, and `cmos_review` names the ids the next
  close will drop. **Consequence:** a store taking this release with rows already four or more
  closes old drops them at its first close, before any earlier warning could have appeared; each is
  one pasted `reopen` from restored.
- **Sprint transitions write the identity pointers the digest reads; the digest labels a fallback
  sprint.** `cmos_sprint` add (with an open status), update (on a status change), and complete now
  keep `master_context.sprint_tracking.current_sprint` (`{id, title, status, focus}`, or `null` when
  nothing is open) and `last_completed_sprint` in step; the close writes them inside its transaction.
  `project_identity.status` is not written by sprint handlers (it is the project's status), and no
  `metadata.current_sprint` / `metadata.sprint_status` keys are created (nothing reads them).
  `cmos_review`'s `sprint` block gains `resolvedBy: "open" | "fallback"`, and a sprint named because
  none is open renders as `[Completed, most recent; none open]` or `[Planned, next; none open]`.
- **Untagged decisions age on wall-clock time in staleness review.** `cmos_decisions(action="review")`
  used to filter out every decision with no sprint tag, so one captured while no sprint was open
  could never be flagged stale however old it was. Untagged rows are now scored by age in 14-day
  periods since creation, and the advisory says so.
- **Supersession candidates are scoped to the capturing sprint and rare-term weighted; receipts are
  bounded.** Eight field reports showed decision capture offering the historical review verdicts a
  close cites as rows to supersede. Candidates now come only from the new decision's own sprint
  (untagged matches untagged); overlap is counted on whole tokens (`sprint` no longer matches
  `sprints`), weighted by inverse document frequency over active decisions with house-style terms
  in more than 30% of them contributing nothing, and ranked by length-normalized similarity; a
  decision the new text cites as `#<id>` is never offered. Each candidate carries a new
  100-character `preview` and a `score`; `decisionText` is kept and now holds the same preview
  rather than the full text, so no key is removed. The rendered capture receipt echoes the first
  100 characters of the content plus its stored length. **Consequence:** a genuine supersession of
  a decision from an earlier sprint is no longer suggested; record it explicitly with
  `cmos_decisions(action="record", supersedes=[...])`.

### Fixed

- **Dependency advisories cleared within existing ranges.** `package-lock.json` moves
  `@hono/node-server`, `hono`, `body-parser`, `qs`, `ip-address`, `fast-uri`, and `fast-xml-parser`
  in the production tree (and eight dev-only packages) to patched versions without changing any
  declared range; `npm audit --omit=dev` goes from 9 findings to 2. The two that remain are
  `@xenova/transformers` → `sharp`, accepted because the text-embedding path never decodes an image
  and the only fix npm offers is a semver-major downgrade of `@xenova/transformers`.

## 3.0.0 — 2026-09-01

Sprint 90 "The Front Door". This is a **MAJOR** release because
`cmos_sprint(action="complete")` removes the published `nextStepsReconciled`,
`nextStepsCarried`, and `pendingFlagged` receipt fields and replaces them with
`nextStepsSurvey`. The published `reopen` next-step sub-action is additive, while the remaining
wire and first-run behavior changes correct defects; neither makes the removed fields
backward-compatible. A 2.9.0 or 2.8.2 cut was therefore rejected.

### Added

### Changed

- **Once a CMOS project is initialized and resolved, fresh installs can start dashboard device-code
  authentication without setting `CMOS_DASHBOARD_URL`.** Explicitly invoking
  `cmos_auth(action="login")` or `login_init` now uses the canonical URL resolver — environment value,
  then baked `https://cmos.aquex.ai` for normal MCP calls — instead of returning
  `DASHBOARD_NOT_CONFIGURED` when the environment variable is absent or empty. Either action can
  therefore make an outbound request to the baked host. `login_complete` uses the same host when
  supplied a `deviceCode`; without one it returns local `MISSING_PARAMETER` and sends nothing. The
  large-delta database-backfill upload remedy now uses the same canonical resolver.
- **Release-version coherence is now one executable class gate instead of a hand-copied
  checklist.** The gate couples `package.json` to both package-lock root stamps, the newest dated
  CHANGELOG heading, and the private authority-document version stamps while explicitly
  classifying schema, template, scaffold, and release-boundary tag axes. It runs on the
  mirror-visible members in the public suite, and the release runbook invokes that same test
  instead of carrying a second inline comparison. The two stale package-lock root stamps were
  corrected from 2.8.0 to match 2.8.1 before this cut and now move with the package version; the
  published `v2.8.1` tag and history are unchanged.
- **Sprint close now treats next-step mission links as provenance, not proof of delivery.** It no
  longer auto-completes `next_steps` rows or deletes context prose merely because it contains a
  completed mission or closing-sprint token, including when optional close-time condensation is
  requested. Close-time retention for the canonical master-resume and project-working-memory
  arrays is count-only (newest 15 / newest 10 respectively); legacy array shapes are left intact.
  The old `nextStepsReconciled`, `nextStepsCarried`, and `pendingFlagged` receipt fields are
  replaced by a whole-ledger `nextStepsSurvey` grouped by closing-sprint, other-sprint, and
  missing-sprint provenance. `cmos_context(action="next_steps")` also adds explicit-ID `reopen`,
  while `carry` to a nonexistent sprint now returns a named `carryToSprint` refusal with
  create-or-park remedies instead of a raw foreign-key failure.
- **The MCP stdio boundary now refuses a wrong-typed `projectRoot` before sender resolution.**
  Re-measured over every (tool, action) pair published by the server's own `tools/list` (83) × six
  non-null wrong JSON values (498 calls), 455 calls in the original 2.8.1 live-store measurement
  change code or outcome. Twenty calls that had succeeded with `projectRoot: 0` now return
  `INVALID_PARAMETER` because that falsy value was treated as absent and silently substituted the
  discovered project, including on registry writes. JSON `null` remains absent-equivalent, and
  `INVALID_ACTION` takes precedence. `projectRoot` is the only published string parameter read
  unsafely before dispatch; the standing AST gate separately re-derives every raw pre-dispatch
  read and the rule-classified unsafe-string subset instead of trusting that sentence.

### Fixed

- **Literal first-run failures over MCP stdio now name the reachable local cause instead of
  reporting an unhandled internal error.** With an empty working directory, a fresh
  `CMOS_CONFIG_DIR`, and no arguments beyond each published action, 74 of 82 driven pairs returned
  `TOOL_EXECUTION_ERROR` with a correlation ID and “report this” advice; the server published 83
  pairs, but the legacy blocking `cmos_auth(login)` action was explicitly excluded. Those 74 paths
  now return `CMOS_NOT_DETECTED`. Separate missing-database, unreadable-database, invalid-identity,
  and ambiguous-sender fixtures pin `DB_NOT_FOUND`, `DB_CONNECTION_FAILED`, and
  `SENDER_UNRESOLVABLE`; none of these known first-run/setup refusals reaches the catch-all.
  The final gate derives and drives all 83 published tool/action pairs with zero exclusions,
  re-drives the network-bearing no-argument auth actions against loopback, and proves missing-code
  `login_complete` refuses locally. `CMOS_NOT_DETECTED` and `DB_NOT_FOUND` repair advice now carries
  a JSON-string `projectRoot`; the gate extracts that emitted value, initializes that exact physical
  root, and proves the original call succeeds on retry.
- **Unknown tool calls now retain the MCP protocol's `-32601` `MethodNotFound` response.** The
  registered boundary previously remapped that already-classified protocol error to `-32603`
  `InternalError`; schema preflight and protocol lookup now run before the review-role write guard,
  while known valid writes remain blocked for review agents.
- **Public mirroring now pushes the filtered branch and release tag as one atomic boundary.** The
  prior sequential pushes could leave public `main` advanced without its tag, and a retry then
  exited early because the tree already matched. The no-diff path now creates or validates the
  missing tag, the branch and tag move in one `git push --atomic` transaction, and the script
  reports the exact public commit id used for independent verification.

## 2.8.1 — 2026-08-30

Sprint 89 "Sweep the Class" — Arc F sprint 3. Corrections and hardening for the 2.8.1 patch.

### Fixed

- **The 2.8.0 notes now disclose the `currentState` response-shape change they were the stated
  reason for accepting.** Decision #1066 admitted the change because "the 2.8.0 release boundary
  makes the shape change explicit"; the 2.8.0 section named the field zero times, filed the change
  under `### Added`, and justified MINOR with a tool-inventory sentence that cannot see a field
  type. The disclosure is now the first bullet of 2.8.0's `### Changed`, and that section's
  preamble states the scope of its MINOR claim and what the claim cannot see.
- A standing repository gate now fingerprints declaration composition (type-alias right-hand
  sides, type parameters, heritage, and every interface member signature) for every `*Error` /
  `*Result` root exported by a CMOS tool module and its `src/`-wide transitive closure, then
  snapshots the 1,486 direct property rows with declared and checker-resolved kinds. It also ledgers mixed-runtime-kind
  rows and explicit opaque/generic blind spots. The tool INPUT surface has had a checked-in snapshot
  since `tests/tools/__snapshots__/tool-definitions.test.ts.snap`; this bounded answer-type surface
  had none, which is why a tool-inventory sentence was the only shape claim the 2.8.0 preamble had
  available.
- `agents.md`'s response-pattern block declared `currentState?: any` and `validValues?: any[]`,
  neither of which is what `src/tools/cmos/types.ts` declares. Both corrected; the block's other
  six fields were checked against the same source and were already right.
- README's error-response section now says what `currentState` actually carries.
- **The seed schema reference no longer names a nonexistent `strategic_decisions.decision`
  column.** The real column is `decision_text`. The false row shipped in 2.8.0 and is copied into
  every new project by `cmos_project(action="init")`; following it made SQLite report
  `no such column: decision`. The shipped-prose gate now executes the seed schema in memory and
  checks column, executable-SQL, and tool/action claims against the artifact that owns each role
  instead of merely checking whether a token exists somewhere in source.
- **Staleness detection now orders canonical sprint IDs numerically instead of by row
  insertion.** Stores whose sprint rows were inserted out of numeric order may flag additional
  stale decisions or learnings on the first staleness-maintenance pass after upgrading.
- **The public clone now has honest tests and a single-source release path.** Tests that require
  private-only evidence skip loudly only in the public mirror and still fail on partial absence
  in the private source. README no longer claims disabled public CI, and the private npm-publish
  workflow is no longer mirrored alongside release tags.
- **Store-level schema labels no longer downgrade or masquerade as migration-completion proof.**
  `metadata.schema_version` is now a monotonic high-water label whose guarded writes re-check the
  current value atomically, while vector storage owns the new
  `metadata.vector_storage_columns = '2.3'` completion marker. A store without that marker performs
  one forced double-FTS rebuild on its next retrieval and then stamps the marker, both provisioning
  missing structures and making the repair self-healing; the current dogfood baseline rebuilt 765
  indexed rows. `cmos_project(action="init")` now preserves and reports an existing 2.4 label
  instead of overwriting and reporting it as 2.1.
- **A wrong-typed published string parameter crashed the tool instead of being refused.** A JSON
  number, object, array or boolean sent for a property the shipped `inputSchema` declares
  `type: "string"` reached an unguarded string method or `path.resolve` and threw, and the
  catch-all boundary dressed the crash as `TOOL_EXECUTION_ERROR` with the message
  `params.missionId.trim is not a function`. Measured across every (tool, valid action,
  declared-string-parameter) triple: **42 of 714 triples crashed; 0 do now.** One schema-driven
  guard at each of the 15 router entry points refuses them as `INVALID_PARAMETER` naming the field.
  > CORRECTION (3.0.0). The sentence “Measured across every (tool, valid action,
  > declared-string-parameter) triple: 42 of 714 triples crashed; 0 do now” is true of the universe
  > it measured and false of the surface a caller touches. Those 714 triples invoked the 15 router
  > functions directly, and the guard sits inside those routers, so it answers for them. It does
  > not answer for MCP stdio: `src/index.ts` resolves `params.projectRoot` through
  > `resolveToolSenderContext` before router dispatch, so a wrong-typed value can throw from
  > `path.resolve` before the guard runs. A historical real-stdio remeasurement over all 83 pairs
  > published by `tools/list` × six non-null wrong JSON values (498 calls) found 380
  > `TOOL_EXECUTION_ERROR` results. The predicate was right; the universe was wrong. The corrected
  > wire claim and its standing gate are recorded in 3.0.0's entries above.
- **A malformed value for a parameter the action actually uses was silently ignored, so filters
  came back unfiltered.** `cmos_learnings(action="list", category=12345)` and
  `cmos_decisions(action="list", since=12345)` dropped the malformed filter and returned the
  UNFILTERED result set, which a caller has every reason to read as filtered. 31 triples were in
  this shape. They are now refused as `INVALID_PARAMETER` naming the field. See `### Changed` for
  the wire-level detail.

- **Two error suggestions prescribed a remedy that reproduced the refusal, and one hid a
  precondition.** `CmosErrors.contextNotFound` and `cmos_context(action="condense")` both told the
  caller to "use `cmos_context(action="view")` to list available contexts"; there is no listing
  action, `view` needs the very row that is missing, and executing it returned the same
  `CONTEXT_NOT_FOUND`. Both now state that the row is absent and must be recreated, and the
  recognized types stay on `validValues`. `cmos_db(action="purge")`'s confirmation refusal now
  discloses that the prescribed retry only runs when the project has a configured dashboard
  mirror. Found by executing the remedies, not by reading them.

### Changed

- **Error codes change for malformed input on parameters an action uses.** The guard above is
  scoped by the published per-action applicability contract (the per-action tables in
  TOOL_REFERENCE.md), so it only inspects parameters the action actually reads — 219 of the 714
  triples. Measured over those 714 triples x four wrong JSON types = 2,856 calls, the transitions
  are:
  - **`TOOL_EXECUTION_ERROR` → `INVALID_PARAMETER`** — 168 calls that previously crashed.
  - **success → `INVALID_PARAMETER`** — 76 calls across 31 triples, all of them a filter or
    identifier the action reads and was silently discarding.
  - **another refusal code → `INVALID_PARAMETER`** — 588 calls that already failed, but under a
    downstream code (`MISSING_PARAMETER`, `DB_QUERY_FAILED` and others) rather than one naming the
    malformed field.

  **1,980 calls are deliberately left untouched**: a malformed value on a parameter the action does
  not read — `cmos_message(action="whoami", body=12345)` — still succeeds, because the call did
  what the caller asked and failing it buys nothing. **JSON `null` is also unaffected** and is still
  treated as an absent optional: all 714 of its outcomes are byte-identical before and after.

- **The catch-all tool boundary no longer claims to know why a call failed.** It used to answer
  every unhandled exception with "This is an internal error, not an input-validation problem —
  retry the call", which was false for the whole wrong-typed-parameter class above and prescribed a
  loop with no exit. It now reports only what that frame knows: an unexpected exception, the raw
  message, the correlationId, and that a repeat with the same inputs indicates a deterministic
  fault.

## 2.8.0 — 2026-08-29

Sprint 88 "Fix the Instrument" — Arc F sprint 2. This release repairs the claims and gates that
made 2.7.0's behavioural audit look more complete than it was, makes sprint close evidence
self-describing, separates read-only discovery from identity registration, and carries migration
warnings all the way to the agent-visible answer.

It is a MINOR release, and the scope of that claim is the TOOL INVENTORY AND ITS INPUTS: the 15
consolidated MCP tools, their `action` values, and their published `inputSchema` properties are
unchanged apart from one added optional input (`evergreen`). **That claim structurally cannot see
a response-shape change, and this release contains one** — no tool declares an MCP `outputSchema`,
so the protocol publishes no response schema for automatic validation of a widened field. The
response change is the first entry under **Changed** below.

> CORRECTION (2.8.1). This preamble originally ended "It remains a MINOR release: no consolidated
> MCP tool was added or removed." That sentence is true and was checked, but it is a tool-inventory
> rule and a reader takes it for a compatibility guarantee it does not provide. Decision #1066
> accepted the `currentState` shape change specifically because "the 2.8.0 release boundary makes
> the shape change explicit"; this section did not make it explicit. The entry below is that debt
> paid, and it is dated to 2.8.1 rather than backdated. On `SESSION_ALREADY_ACTIVE` specifically,
> `currentState` changed from a session-id string to `{ id, type, title, startedAt, captureCount }`.
> Consumers should branch on `error.code`, read `.id` for that error, and narrow the field before
> applying generic string operations.

### Changed

- **`error.currentState` can now be an object instead of a string — on one error code.**
  `cmos_session(action="start")` returning `SESSION_ALREADY_ACTIVE` used to put the active
  session's id there as a bare string (`"PS-2026-08-29-006"`). It now puts a five-field object —
  `{ id, type, title, startedAt, captureCount }` — where `captureCount` is `null` when the stored
  capture value is missing, malformed, or not an array. `CmosToolError.currentState` widened from `string` to
  `string | Record<string, unknown>` to allow it, and the value reaches MCP clients on
  `structuredContent`, not only in the rendered text. **No other error uses an object today**: 13
  other sites set a status string (`"In Progress"`, `"Completed"`, `"Dropped"`, …), and the
  sprint-complete site passes its status when present or omits the field when it is null. Branch
  on `error.code` and read `error.currentState.id` for this one code. Calling a string method such
  as `startsWith` without narrowing now throws, direct equality with the former id returns false,
  and interpolation yields `[object Object]`. Code that handles `currentState` generically across
  error codes should test `typeof currentState === 'string'` first. The rendered
  `content[0].text` channel did not suffer this coercion break; it now adds a five-line
  active-session detail block (id plus type, title, start time, and capture count). This stayed a
  MINOR bump on measured grounds: the field is diagnostic data for one error code, the supported
  type entrypoint (`dist/index.d.ts`) does not export `CmosToolError`, and `exports` publishes no
  subpath, so modern exports-aware Node and TypeScript resolution reject the deep import. The
  underlying `dist/tools/cmos/types.d.ts` does ship, however, and legacy exports-blind TypeScript
  resolution can reach it; a bespoke consumer may therefore observe the break. No tool declares
  an `outputSchema`, so MCP metadata exposes no response schema for automatic client validation.
  Pin `2.7.0` if your integration cannot accommodate the change.
- **Read-classified calls and `cmos_review` no longer register a project or mint its identity.**
  `getProjectId` is now a pure lookup. Explicit `cmos_project(action="register")` and ordinary
  write boundaries perform registration and identity persistence instead, including an explicit
  `projectRoot`. Identity-less reads continue to work and now disclose their unattributed state
  on the answer rather than only on process stderr.
- **Project identity collisions fail closed at registration and restore boundaries.** Physical
  path aliases resolve to the same store, identity-less snapshots are reconciled to the live
  identity, and a foreign snapshot is rejected with database and graph state rolled back.
- **Sprint ordering is numeric for canonical ids.** `sprint-9` now sorts before `sprint-10` while
  mixed or non-canonical ids retain a deterministic fallback order.
- **Dependency relationships are documented as record-only.** `Blocks`, `Requires`, and `Enables`
  feed ordering and graph expansion; they do not prevent a mission from starting or completing.
- **Migration and sync warnings reach the existing response warning channel.** All 41 answer-bound
  calls to the 21 exported `MigrationResult`-compatible schema helpers now consume or forward
  warnings; the 7 remaining calls have no answer carrier. Pull-before-push warnings also survive
  every mutable-push success and error path, with exact-string deduplication.

### Added

- **Sprint-close receipts now audit the process that produced them.** The result includes
  `activeSessionsAtClose`, `startupBuildTime`, and `driftMinutes`, verifies that the archival id
  arrays exist, and renders reconnect guidance from the measured process state.
- **Session-capture receipts identify what was written and when it materializes.** Decision and
  learning captures return their row id, next-step captures disclose that they materialize at
  session close, learning capture accepts `evergreen`, and `SESSION_ALREADY_ACTIVE` identifies the
  active session and its pending captures.
- Standing tests now inventory legacy tool-definition modules, prove shipped `Last Updated` stamps
  change when their body changes, cover both `.execute()` and `.raw()` write guards, and publish
  executable semantic warning censuses. The formatter census closes from 93 of 103 genuine render
  returns carrying warnings to 103 of 103; deliberate error preambles and delegations are counted
  separately.

### Fixed

- Rejected next-step writes no longer misreport SQL failures as `unmatchedIds`, and completed sprint
  guidance no longer tells an operator to complete work that is already complete. Seven shipped
  assertions found by the sprint-87 review were corrected rather than preserved as compatibility
  text.
- `cmos_sprint(action="analytics")` now states that its counts use direct `sprint_id` membership and
  reports an unavailable count as unknown rather than zero.
- Advisory schema migrations no longer report false-current after a failed or incomplete DDL step.
  They validate same-named virtual tables and triggers before claiming them, rebuild empty FTS
  indexes when source rows exist, retry when a missing base table later appears, preserve schema
  markers newer than 2.3, and warn without throwing or overwriting a conflicting object.
- The schema write guard now sees raw DDL as well as prepared execution, closing the path that could
  swallow a failed `CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE` and still return `alreadyCurrent: true`.

## 2.7.0 — 2026-08-28

Sprint 87 "Mean What You Say" — Arc F sprint 1. Sprint 86 closed the axis a mechanical gate can
see: every identifier a surface names now exists. This one is the behavioural half — a surface
that asserts something that is not so where no name-existence sweep can look. A remedy that names
the wrong cause. A count that reports a write while hiding which rows it touched. An instrument
that reads evidence it created.

### Changed

- **`cmos_sprint(action="complete")` names the ids it archived, and hands back an undo handle.**
  The result gains `archivedDecisionIds`, `learningIds` and `preCloseSnapshotId`, and the rendered
  close line prints the ids rather than only a count, truncating past 30 with an explicit
  `+K more`. The archival was previously unnamed on the tool's published description, unitemised
  in its return, and irreversible.
- **`evergreen = 1` learnings are no longer archived at sprint close.** A behaviour change on a
  ratified write: an institutional-rule learning an operator flagged is no longer demoted every
  time a sprint ends. Decisions have no equivalent flag and are unaffected.
- **`cmos_status.last_sync_at` and `cmos_agent_onboard`'s sync-health counts now describe THIS
  project.** They were fetched unscoped and reported a platform-wide figure inside a
  project-scoped payload, so **these numbers change value on every install**. On this machine
  `last_sync_at` was 32 days optimistic.
- **Portfolio drift reasons now read "no new CMOS rows in Nd" instead of "no CMOS write in Nd",
  because the mechanism changed with the word.** Store freshness is derived from the newest row
  stamp across six domain tables rather than from a file mtime — a signal `cmos_review`'s own
  cross-store fan-out created by opening each store. Measured effect: silent stores 3 → 5, with
  two previously-understated ages corrected (41d → 105d, 41d → 78d) and one store that had been
  classified FRESH for months newly reported at 48d.
- **`MISSION_TERMINAL_STATUSES` no longer contains `Failed`,** which widens a live
  orphan-detection predicate: a sprint-less mission stored as `Failed` now reports as orphaned.
  Unwitnessed — no such row exists in this store or across the fleet.
- **Provenance tags stop naming `unknown-project`.** A row whose store records no identity now
  renders as `unattributed` rather than `proj:unknown-project`, which named a project that does
  not exist on the prompt-injection defence surface. **The untrusted fence is unchanged** — those
  rows are still framed as foreign.
- **`MessageSendResult.messageId` is now optional.** The dashboard's send route returns
  `messageId`; this field read `id` and rendered `ID: undefined` on every successful send. When no
  id comes back the line is omitted and an envelope warning names the absence.
- **`cmos_agent_onboard`'s messaging block reports a project-scoped unread count**, replacing
  `unreadCount` with `unreadCountScoped` / `unreadCountUserWide` / `unreadScope`.
- **The next-steps transition accepts `carried` rows.** Rows carried to a later sprint could not
  previously be completed, dropped or re-carried by id.
- **`skipped-unconfigured` is gone from the startup key-recovery status union.**

### Added

- `preCloseSnapshotId` on the sprint-close result — a database snapshot taken BEFORE the closeout
  transaction, so every archived row is restorable.
- `unmatchedIds` on the next-steps result: which requested ids a transition did not match.
- `unreadCountScoped` / `unreadScope` on `ListMessagesResult`.
- `--strict` on `npm run baseline:cross-store`, which exits non-zero when any store's counts are
  unreliable rather than publishing a partial share under a zero exit code.
- A per-store identity disclosure that names the store whose identity is unrecorded. It was one
  process-wide line naming no path, so in a portfolio fan-out the first affected store silenced
  every other one. **It is a disclosure, and heals no already-stamped row** — restamping rows that
  already carry the `unknown-project` literal is an operator action outside this package. Swept at
  close with `find <home> -maxdepth 7 -path '*/cmos/db/cmos.sqlite' -not -path '*/node_modules/*'`:
  45 stores, 32 resolving by a non-empty `project_id`, 13 collapsing to the literal, 0
  unclassifiable. Scope limit: one home directory on one machine — the count bounds nothing beyond
  it.

### Fixed

- **The mission-transition surface no longer crashes on a mission row this repo's own store
  holds.** Six handlers dereferenced a state-transition table with a status read from the
  database, throwing an unhandled `TypeError` that the MCP boundary reported as "an internal
  error … retry the call" — a loop with no exit. 15 mission rows across 4 of 21 registered stores
  were unusable through `cmos_mission_transition`.
- Two false refusal strings: a terminal mission was said to be unchangeable when only its STATUS
  is settled, and an unrecognized status was answered with a transition error rather than being
  named.
- A read-only client could not open a store that was not already in WAL mode, because the
  `journal_mode` pragma is itself a write and was issued unconditionally. Latent: no shipped code
  path passes `readonly: true` to that client today.
- The published seed no longer ships three empty-string identity rows, and its `Schema Version`
  stamps and one documented column name (`event_data` → `payload`) now match the schema it ships.
- The `whoami` no-roots warning no longer fires alongside a fully resolved payload.
- A `cmos_auth(action="reissue")` that fails dashboard-side no longer destroys the local project
  key, and its error message no longer double-prefixes `Dashboard error:`.

### Removed

Every entry here is unreachable or ignored surface **by measurement**, which is what keeps this
release MINOR rather than MAJOR. Each cites its evidence.

- `CmosReviewResult.warnings` — assigned `[]` at `cmos-review.ts` exactly once and never written
  anywhere, so its renderer could only ever print an empty list and its size-trim stage could only
  ever remove nothing. The **envelope** warnings channel is a different object and is unaffected.
- `MessagingSummary.unreadCount`, replaced by `unreadCountScoped` / `unreadCountUserWide` /
  `unreadScope`. Measured live: `.data.messaging === null` — the block carrying this field did not
  render at all, because its client resolved through an env-only path that errors on a device-code
  install. See the revival below.
- `'none'` from the `KeySource` union — **no producer in `src/` ever emitted it**; a resolver that
  finds no credential returns a failure rather than a success carrying `keySource: 'none'`. Now
  asserted by a standing gate that every union member has a producer
  (`tests/auth/user-scoped-resolution-gate.test.ts`).
- `skipped-unconfigured` from the startup-recovery status union — **zero producers** once the
  null-client path routes through classification, asserted by the same gate. It was not repointed:
  filing a genuine internal inconsistency under a word meaning "not configured" would name the
  wrong cause, and a store holding keys is not unconfigured.

**The one genuine consumer break is in `### Changed`, not here:** `MessageSendResult.messageId`
becomes optional. It ships MINOR on this project's own measured precedent — `## 2.4.0`'s "One
consumer-visible break — see **Changed**" and 2.6.0's `unreadCount` → `unreadCountUserWide`
rename — and it carries its own named bullet rather than being bundled.

### Revived

Two surfaces that were silently absent, not wrong. Said as revivals deliberately: claiming a wrong
number was corrected would assert something that never happened on screen.

- **`cmos_agent_onboard`'s messaging block STARTS APPEARING** for device-code installs. It
  resolved its client through an env-only path, so on such installs it errored and returned null
  with an explicit "don't warn" comment — the block rendered nothing at all.
- **The `Healed stale cmos_address from X to Y` notice STARTS APPEARING** on the strict-success
  path, where it has been silently dropped since sprint 53.

## 2.6.0 — 2026-08-12

Sprint 86 "Say Only What You Know" — the honest-surface release. Sprint 85 made the durable
**record** honest; this release makes the **surface** honest: a shipped string, count or schema
that confidently asserts something that is not so. The **15-tool contract holds** —
`cmos_mission` gains a `move` action, which is a new action on an existing tool, not a 16th tool.

Nothing that worked was taken away. The two `### Removed` entries below are unreachable or
ignored surface, which is why this is a MINOR and not a MAJOR.

### Changed

- **Counts and success flags returned by write actions are now computed from what the database
  did, rather than from what the handler intended (s86 m02).** The one operators have been
  reading is `cmos_sprint(action="complete").nextStepsReconciled`: it now reports the rows the
  bulk `UPDATE` actually changed. That number can differ from the intended count for **two
  different reasons, and they are not the same news**. Either the statement errored — which is
  now surfaced as a `writeFailures` entry carrying the database's own error code — or a target
  row was simply no longer `pending` when the statement ran, which is a benign `WHERE`-miss and
  produces **no** `writeFailures` entry. A lower number is not by itself evidence that anything
  went wrong; read `writeFailures` to tell the two apart.
- **`cmos_sprint(action="list")` and `cmos_sprint(action="show")` now report `totalMissions`
  EXCLUDING Deferred and Dropped missions, accompanied by a new `parkedMissions` count
  (s86 m08).** This is a corrected count on two **read** actions, and it is a separate risk
  from the write-side change above: the numbers move on every store, for every sprint that ever
  deferred or dropped a mission, with no call-site change on the consumer's part. A sprint that
  completed all its live work while parking some now reads as complete instead of being
  permanently punished in its own denominator. Both actions read the `sprint_summary` view
  directly, so a store gets the new numbers as soon as the view migration runs. Where the view
  cannot be upgraded (a read-only store, or a same-named base table already occupying the name),
  both actions report `parkedMissions: 0` and carry the migration's reason rather than failing.
- **33 published numeric declarations tighten from `"type": "number"` to `"type": "integer"`
  (s86 m04).** CLIENT-SIDE VALIDATION ONLY — no server behaviour changes, and no call that was
  correct before is rejected now. 30 scalar parameters plus 3 array item types (`nextStepIds`,
  `constraintIds`, `decisionIds`). Three parameters deliberately remain `number` because they
  are genuinely non-integer: `cmos_sprint.targetSizePercent`, `cmos_context.targetSizePercent`
  and `cmos_context.recencyWeight`.
- **SEPARATE, and a different risk class: three input schemas change their accepted value sets
  (s86 m04), and one of them WIDENS.** `cmos_learnings.status`'s **published** enum widens from
  `['active','archived','superseded']` to include **`'stale'`** — the server has been writing
  that value itself (`src/tools/cmos/staleness-detection.ts:519`,
  `UPDATE learnings SET status = 'stale'`), and 246 such rows exist
  across 7 of the 18 stores measured, so the published contract had been forbidding callers from
  naming a value the server writes. `cmos_decisions` never had this asymmetry, which is the
  evidence the enum was the wrong side rather than the data. With the set corrected,
  `cmos_learnings.status` and `cmos_decisions.status` tighten from a bare string to that
  four-member enum, so a value outside it is now a validation error instead of a silent no-match.
  `cmos_learnings.category` goes the **other** way: its published enum is **dropped entirely**
  and its input stays a free string, because the column is `TEXT` with no `CHECK` constraint and
  a closed set claimed an enforcement the server does not perform — the fleet already carries an
  out-of-set value. The four canonical categories are documented as guidance, not as a contract.
- **Every leaf formatter now renders the envelope `warnings` channel (s86 m02).**
  `CmosToolResult.warnings` ships inside `structuredContent`, but an agent reads
  `content[0].text` — so a warning no formatter rendered was present in the payload and
  unreadable in practice. Measured before the fix, across 76 leaf formatters: **14 rendered the
  envelope channel, 57 rendered nothing at all, a further 4 rendered only a data-level
  `warnings` field of their own** (a different channel), and 1 takes no result at all. So 61
  leaves were silent on the envelope channel. **Consumer-visible consequence: advisories that
  have been shipping invisible since 2.5.0 — including s85-m04's `missionId` advisory — appear
  in the text channel for the first time.** Answers get longer; nothing else about them changes.
- **Separately: the write actions that can partially fail now render a data-level
  `writeFailures` block (s86 m02b).** This is a **different channel** from the envelope
  `warnings` above — it is `result.data.writeFailures`, not an envelope field — and it is
  carried by the seven actions whose writes can fail row-wise while the answer still succeeds:
  `cmos_sprint(complete)`, `cmos_session(capture)`, `cmos_session(complete)`,
  `cmos_context(next_steps)`, `cmos_context(constraints)`, `cmos_decisions(batch_update)` and
  `cmos_project(update)`. An empty list renders nothing, deliberately: a `WHERE` that matched no
  rows is a legitimate outcome, not a failure. Other actions do not carry this field.
- **`cmos_message(action="list").unreadCount` is renamed to `unreadCountUserWide`, joined by a
  new view-scoped `unreadInThisView` (s86 m07).** The dashboard's unread number is USER-WIDE
  across every project you own, while the rows returned beside it are scoped to the calling
  credential, tab and filters — under one name they produced a header that read
  `0 total, 7 unread` against an empty pending inbox, a badge that names no project and can
  never clear. `unreadInThisView` counts the returned rows with status `pending`. **Consumer
  risk: a JSON key disappears — anything reading `unreadCount` off this result now gets
  `undefined`.** A non-fatal warning also names the scope mismatch whenever the resolved
  credential is not project-scoped.
- **The exported TypeScript type `ResolveAddressResult` is corrected to the wire shape
  (s86 m07).** `resolved` changes from `boolean` to an object
  (`{userId?, username?, displayName?, projectId?, projectName?, projectSlug?}`), and the
  never-populated top-level `projectName` / `agentId` members are gone. The endpoint has always
  returned an object here; the declaration described a response it does not send. **Consumer
  risk: a TypeScript compile break for anyone importing the type** — a different risk class
  from the rename above, which no TS consumer sees at compile time.
- **`cmos_message(action="send")` may now return non-fatal `warnings`, and
  `cmos_message(action="directory")` rows gain `createdAt`, `ownerDisplayName`, `ambiguousWith`
  and a correctly-populated `isOwner` (s86 m07).** A send whose target shares a slug prefix with
  another project under the same owner — the `cmos://derek/cmos-mcp` vs
  `cmos://derek/cmos-mcp-pro` case — now says so in the rendered answer and carries
  `targetProjectId` / `targetProjectName` for the project it actually reached. **The send is
  never blocked by this check.** Directory rows carry the ambiguity annotation and, for the
  first time, a real ownership signal: the public directory route never returns `isOwner`, so
  every row (including your own) was previously framed as foreign. `createdAt` is the
  REGISTRATION date and is labelled as such — it is not an activity or freshness signal.
  **Consumer risk: additive only.**
- **`cmos_auth(action="reissue").revokedKeyIds` reports the keyIds the dashboard actually
  revoked** instead of always `[]`, and names them in the rendered answer rather than only in
  `structuredContent`. A success answer previously asserted "nothing was revoked" while the
  dashboard had revoked N keys. A companion **`revokedKeyIdsReported`** boolean distinguishes
  "the dashboard reported an empty list" from "the dashboard reported no list at all" — the
  response body is not validated, so an absent field must not be rendered as an empty one.
- **Attribution failures are two distinct errors, not one wrong cause.** The single
  `DEVICE_CODE_REQUIRED` message asserted that the device-code flow "must be run", which is
  false whenever the credential store already holds a user-scoped key — the credentials existed
  and worked, they simply were not the ones selected. `DEVICE_CODE_REQUIRED` is now returned
  only for a store with zero user-scoped keys (and names the store's path); a resolved
  credential that cannot be attributed (caller-supplied override, legacy
  `CMOS_DASHBOARD_API_KEY`, or the user+password fallback) returns the new
  **`CREDENTIAL_NOT_ATTRIBUTABLE`** naming which arm supplied it.
- **`cmos_auth(action="rotate")` no longer passes a dashboard 401 through blind.** The generic
  suggestion pointed every install at `CMOS_DASHBOARD_USER`/`CMOS_DASHBOARD_PASSWORD`; rotate
  now names the local row's keyId, states that it authenticates with the project-scoped
  credential resolved for that root, and points at `reissue`. The error **code is unchanged**
  (`DASHBOARD_AUTH_FAILED`) and rotate's credential selection is deliberately untouched.
- **The `DASHBOARD_AUTH_FAILED` suggestion no longer names only the password fallback.**
  Device code has been the default bootstrap since 2.x; the suggestion now covers the arms that
  exist without asserting which one authenticated.
- **Startup project-key recovery: `skipped-no-parent-key-id` is replaced by
  `skipped-no-user-scoped-key` and `skipped-unattributable-credential`, both logged at
  `[WARN]`** (previously one status at `[INFO]`). Its message also no longer claims that
  `/reissue` on the next startup will recover the key — startup recovery skips outright whenever
  a local row exists. Consumers matching the old status string must update.

### Added

- **`cmos_mission(action="move", missionId, toSprintId)` — a supported sprint re-bind
  (s86 m08).** `missions.sprint_id` carried two facts in one column ("which sprint created
  this" and "which sprint owns its execution"), and until now the only way to correct it was
  raw SQL against durable state. The move refuses a terminal mission and refuses a closed
  destination sprint, and it distinguishes a destination that does not exist from one that is
  closed — the two need different corrective actions. A new **action on an existing tool**: the
  15-tool contract is unchanged.
- **`sprint_summary.parked_missions`** — the view now carries the Deferred/Dropped count
  alongside the corrected `total_missions`. Applied by a lazy migration on first read.
- **Three parameters that the handlers supported but the tool schema never published, and the
  router never forwarded (s86 m03): `cmos_context.statusFilter`, `cmos_session.expiresAt` and
  `cmos_session.agentFeedback`.** Stated precisely, because it is easy to describe wrongly: at
  2.5.0 none of these three appeared on the tool it belongs to. `agentFeedback` was published
  only on `cmos_agent_onboard` and `cmos_mission_transition`; `statusFilter` only on
  `cmos_project`; `expiresAt` appeared in no shipped artifact at all. The behaviour existed in
  the handlers and there was no way for a caller to reach it. 2.6.0 publishes all three on the
  right tools and wires the router through to them. **Consumer risk: additive.** These are new
  parameters, not repairs to a contract you could already have depended on — the input schemas
  are strict, so a 2.5.0 client passing them got a validation error rather than a silent no-op.
- **`cmos_learnings(action="reaffirm").evergreen` is live**, and the answer carries
  `previousEvergreen` / `newEvergreen` so a caller can see whether the flag actually moved.
- **Per-action parameter tables in `TOOL_REFERENCE.md`.** The generated reference now shows
  which parameters belong to which action, rather than one flat table per tool.

### Fixed

- **`cmos_auth(action="reissue")` now works in the state it exists for (s86 m06).** Reissue is
  the documented lost-key recovery path, and it succeeded only when the local project-key row
  was **absent** — the one state it is not needed in. Client resolution returns a
  project-scoped credential whenever a local row merely EXISTS (the local store has no
  revocation or expiry concept), so a present-but-revoked row short-circuited resolution,
  the mint could not be attributed to a parent credential, and the call failed. Reissue now
  resolves through a new user-scoped entry point (`DashboardClient.fromEnvForUser`, arms
  3 → 4 → 5). **Arm order and `keySource` values are unchanged for every other caller** — both
  entry points share one copy of the chain.
- **A reissue that cannot attribute the mint no longer destroys the local project-key row.**
  The row was removed _before_ the handler discovered the credential problem, so an operator
  asking for a repair was left with no project key at all — strictly worse off than before the
  call. Classification now precedes every write. **Scope, stated precisely:** this covers the
  credential-attribution failures, which are the ones an operator reaches when already broken.
  A reissue that gets past attribution and then fails dashboard-side (the mint 500s or 401s)
  still clears the row first — unchanged from previous releases, and load-bearing, because the
  underlying recovery call is a no-op while a row is present. Restoring the row on a
  dashboard-side failure is tracked as follow-up hardening.
- **The reissue error suggestion is rendered.** `cmos_auth`'s formatter dropped
  `error.suggestion` entirely, and only the formatted text becomes `content[0].text` — so every
  auth suggestion string was invisible in the channel agents read.
- **`cmos_sprint(action="analytics", limit=N)` returned the OLDEST N sprints and called them
  "recent" (s86 m05).** The bound was applied to an ascending ordering, so an operator asking
  for the last 5 sprints got sprints 9–13 of an 86-sprint history, with trend directions
  computed over them. The `LIMIT` now binds a descending ordering inside a subquery with
  oldest-first restored outside it — the trend comparison depends on ascending input, so a bare
  `ORDER BY` flip would have inverted every reported direction instead. The answer also echoes
  the window it actually analysed.
- **`cmos_message(action="send")` could deliver to the wrong project when two projects under
  the same owner share a slug prefix (s86 m07)** — the `cmos://derek/cmos-mcp` vs
  `cmos://derek/cmos-mcp-pro` case. Resolution is exact-match first, and an ambiguous address is
  named in the answer with the project actually reached.
- **Shipped documentation that contradicted the security document in the same tarball
  (s86 m05).** `README.md` asserted three data-loss guarantees — a `deleted_at`-style soft
  delete, automatic pre-destructive snapshots, and blanket dry-run support — that `SECURITY.md`
  in the same published package explicitly refuted, and that contradiction shipped in 2.3.0,
  2.4.0 and 2.5.0. **`SECURITY.md` was the correct document**; `README.md` and
  `docs/getting-started.md` were moved toward it, never the reverse, and each claim was verified
  at source (no table has a `deleted_at` column; `CMOS_AUTO_SNAPSHOT` is read by nothing in the
  tree). A gate now resolves every code-shaped identifier in the shipped prose against `src/`,
  the seed schema, and `package.json` scripts and `files[]`.
- **`cmos-seed/README.md`'s Quick Start named a command the server rejects** — the seed's own
  recommended first call.

### Removed

Both entries are surface that was unreachable or ignored. Neither is a working capability, which
is why 2.6.0 is a MINOR.

- **`cmos_context(action="update").arrayUpdates.decisions_made` and `.learnings` (s86 m04).**
  Dead since Sprint 51's context-blob reduction: the handler's `hasArrayUpdates` check tested
  only the two surviving keys, so a caller passing `decisions_made` **alone** received
  `INVALID_PARAMETER` — from an error whose own suggestion told them to pass `decisions_made`.
  `arrayUpdates.constraints` and `arrayUpdates.context_notes` are unaffected.
- **`CMOS_ERROR_CODES.BUILD_STALE` and the `errors.buildStale` factory (s86 m05).** Unreachable
  since the s74 review retired the enforced build-freshness gate — no caller, and no test
  enumerated the constant. Its `suggestion:` string also told operators to "pass
  `forceComplete: true` to override", a parameter the same package documents as a no-op. The
  live, unrelated `buildStaleAdvisory` in `cmos_sprint(action="complete")` is untouched:
  build-freshness remains advisory and never blocks a close.

## 2.5.0 — 2026-08-10

Sprint 85 "Honest Provenance" — the write-behavior release. The **15-tool contract holds**.
This release changes what the durable record says when nothing is open: the stamp is now
honest, at the cost of some sprint-scoped reporting no longer counting untagged work.

### Changed

- **A session started when no sprint is in an open status now records
  `sessions.sprint_id = NULL` (s85 m03).** Previously the session inherited the most recent
  **Completed** sprint — a durable stamp naming a sprint that was already closed. Decisions,
  learnings, constraints **and next-steps** captured in such a session likewise record
  `sprint_id = NULL`. Display is deliberately unchanged: onboard, review and mission status
  still _name_ the most recent sprint — "which sprint am I looking at" and "which sprint
  should this row carry" are now answered by two different resolvers, on purpose.
- **A `Planned` sprint with only Queued missions no longer receives the write-side tag
  either**, though display still names it. A `Planned` sprint carrying an In Progress or
  Current mission, or any sprint in an open status (Active / In Progress / Current), still
  tags writes normally.
- **Decisions captured with no open sprint are excluded from `cmos_decisions(action="review")`
  staleness triage** — its scoring filters `sprint_id IS NOT NULL`. A new advisory on that
  action reports the excluded count (`N active decisions have no sprint tag and are excluded
from staleness scoring`) rather than hiding the gap.
- **Sprint-scoped retro, analytics and close-summary counts drop for untagged work.**
  `cmos_sprint(action="retro")` and `cmos_sprint(action="complete")` each now name the
  untagged count explicitly instead of under-reporting silently. No `session_missions`
  fallback attribution is performed — that would reinvent the guessing the write path
  refuses to do.
- **Context retention no longer prunes untagged sessions.** A session with NULL `sprint_id`
  is retained by `removeArchivedDetail` rather than swept with its (former) sprint.
- **`cmos_sprint(action="carry_forward")` no longer emits the `null_sprint_sessions` item.**
  Its stated cause ("require dashboard event processor update") was never a dashboard bug,
  and after this release a NULL `sprint_id` is the intended record, not a defect to escalate.
- **No migration, no backfill — go-forward only.** Existing rows are untouched by design:
  the dashboard mirror's session upsert is `COALESCE(existing, incoming)` and cannot clear a
  value, so a local NULL-out of historical rows would diverge from the mirror permanently.
- `cmos_session(action="start")` on a store with nothing open returns `sprintId: null`,
  `sprintAutoTagged: false`, a new **`advisorySprintId`** field carrying the read-resolved
  hint, and a warning telling the caller the session is recorded untagged. The hint rides a
  separate field because `{sprintId, sprintAutoTagged: false}` already means "the caller
  passed `sprintId` explicitly".

### Added

- **`missionId` on `cmos_session(action="complete")` (s85 m04, #487).** The consolidated
  router now forwards the existing top-level param to the complete path, and the
  `decisions[]` / `nextSteps[]` INSERT paths stamp `mission_id`. Per-capture `missionId`
  still wins for next-steps; the call-level value applies uniformly to decisions.
- **`missionId` filters on `cmos_decisions(action="list")`, `cmos_learnings(action="list")`
  and `cmos_context(action="next_steps")` (s85 m04).** The mission → row trail is now
  queryable end-to-end; rows with NULL `mission_id` are excluded by the filter, not errored.
- **A non-blocking warning on decision/learning captures that omit `missionId`** while at
  least one mission is In Progress/Current, naming the candidate mission ids and the exact
  param. Next-step captures never warn (96.4% of next-steps are born at session-complete
  with no mission in progress — it would be pure noise). Nothing is ever silently inferred.
- **Two indexes**: `idx_learnings_mission` and `idx_next_steps_mission`, in the seed schema
  and as marker-gated migrations, so the new filters don't table-scan.

### Fixed

- **`mission_id` was omitted from two `cmos_session(action="complete")` INSERT paths**
  (the `nextSteps[]` and `decisions[]` column lists), so rows born there could never carry
  provenance even when the caller knew the mission.
- **The dedup-ordering shadow bug**: identical text passed in both `nextSteps[]` and a
  next-step capture carrying `missionId` let the unstamped insert win and skip the stamped
  twin. The mission-bearing capture loop now runs first.

## 2.4.0 — 2026-08-10

Sprint 84 "Messaging-Cutover Adoption + Trust-Hardening" plus sprint 85's published-surface
hygiene. The **15-tool contract holds**. One consumer-visible break — see **Changed**.

### Changed

- **A dashboard 403 now surfaces as `DASHBOARD_FORBIDDEN`, not `DASHBOARD_AUTH_FAILED` (s84 m02).**
  **This is the one break in this release.** 401 and 403 previously shared an arm in the
  `DashboardClient` request path, so an authorization failure was reported as an authentication
  failure. Any consumer branching on the error-code string must update. Beyond the naming, the
  split fixes a latent bug the sprint-47 dashboard cutover triggers: an `apiKey` client that read
  a 403 as "auth failed" cleared its cached token and sent `Bearer null` on the next call.
- **Foreign mission / sprint / session text is framed at read time (s84 m03).** After a
  `cmos_db(action="pull")`, local tables can hold rows authored in another project. Mission
  name/objective/context, sprint title/focus and session title now render inside the untrusted
  provenance fence when the row's `project_id` differs from the resolved local project, across
  ~10 read surfaces (`cmos_agent_onboard` pending/blocked, `cmos_mission` list/show/status, the
  `cmos_review` portfolio and sprint fields). Local rows still render bare. Column-presence is
  PRAGMA-guarded, so ancient stores degrade to `NULL` rather than throwing. This closes the
  known limitation documented in 2.3.0 and the SECURITY.md mission-start gap.
- **Build-freshness advisories are gated to `projectType === 'build'` (s84 m05).** A `general` or
  `managed` project no longer receives build-tier staleness advice it has no use for.

### Added

- **`offset` + `returnedCount` on `cmos_message(action="list")` (s84 m02).** SQL-side pagination
  against the dashboard's own paging, so large inboxes page without re-fetching. Omitting
  `offset` reproduces the previous request byte-for-byte.
- **`cmos_message(action="get")` (s84 m02).** Read one message by id with its full body, notes and
  evidence — the byte-capped `list` summaries stay small and the body is fetched on demand.
  Shipped as an **action**, not a 16th tool.
- **`evergreen` on the constraint reaffirm path (s84 m05).** `cmos_context(action="constraints",
constraintAction="reaffirm", evergreen=true)` sets a durable flag that permanently excludes an
  institutional rule from staleness review and the stale-constraint banner. Unlike a plain
  reaffirm — which only resets the clock and ages out again — this does not decay.
- **`npm run prune:snapshots` (s84 m04).** Reclaims the write-only `context_snapshots.content`
  blob (~99% of that table) by **content-tombstone**: the row, all metadata, `content_hash`, the
  `strategic_decisions.snapshot_id` foreign key and the `snapshot_taken` event are all kept; only
  the content bytes are released. **Dry-run by default**; `--apply` is required and is
  irreversible. `cmos_context(action="history")` now surfaces `contentPruned` per row, and
  `cmos_sprint(action="complete")` emits a non-blocking growth advisory — never an auto-prune.
- **Additive identity UUIDs on message rows (s84 m01).** `senderUserId` / `senderProjectId` /
  `targetUserId` / `targetProjectId` alongside the existing fields.

### Fixed

- **`TOOL_REFERENCE.md` shipped a malformed table row (s85 m01).** The renderer interpolated a
  JSON-Schema type union (`string | object`) raw into a markdown table cell, and the bare pipe
  split that row into an extra column. The type cell now passes through the table-cell escaper.
  A new render-validity gate asserts a column-count invariant over the real definitions plus an
  adversarial synthetic — the existing freshness gate compares rendered against committed output
  and is structurally unable to catch a formatting defect.
- **181 agent-facing references named tools or actions that do not exist (s85 m01).** Strings that
  teach an agent how to call CMOS were left behind by the 38→15 tool consolidation, in error
  `suggestion` fields, `warnings[]`, tool descriptions and rendered output — including two invalid
  actions in the general-tier first-session prompt and two non-existent tools emitted on every
  stale-context session start. All corrected to their consolidated forms, now guarded by a
  mechanical AST-based gate over `src/` with no allowlist.
- **The bundled seed docs taught a tool surface that no longer exists (s85 m01).** `cmos-seed/`
  ships in the package and is copied into every project by `cmos_project(action="init")`; its five
  docs — including `build-session-prompt.md`, the recipe a fresh project's build agent follows —
  carried 118 stale references, advertised "27+ tools", and listed a `cmos_backlog_export()` that
  has never existed. Rewritten to the 15-tool action-dispatched surface and covered by the same
  gate.
- **Version-tolerant message NAME reads (s84 m01).** The sprint-47 dashboard cutover repurposes
  `targetProject` / `senderProject` to slugs and adds `*Name` twins; reads now prefer the name
  field and fall back, so they are correct in both eras. Byte-identical to 2.3.0 on pre-cutover
  rows.
- **Schema fidelity on two dual-surface params (s85 m01).** `cmos_mission`'s `context` (top-level
  and nested in `fields`) declared no type while zod already accepted a string-or-object union, so
  the reference published a bare `object` for a param where a string is legal;
  `cmos_context`'s `fieldUpdates[].value` now declares the complete JSON Schema type set, matching
  its deliberately unconstrained zod side.

### Internal

- `TierConfig.toolsUse` removed — unreachable, since the exports map allows only `.` and
  `./package.json` (s84 m05).
- `npm run snapshots:update` added; the bare `snapshots` script omits `-u` and fails rather than
  rewriting, which every re-baseline hit (s85 m01).
- `verify:dist` extended with the s84 answer shapes: the pagination param on the built schema, the
  evergreen flag's durable round-trip, and `contentPruned` on `cmos_context(action="history")`.

## 2.3.0 — 2026-07-11

Arc E "Retrieval + Tiers" — the **last phase-2 arc; phase 2 is complete.** Two sprints: **E1 (s82) Retrieval Spine** — an honest recall gate plus the mission-recall lever — and **E2 (s83) Tiers + Framing** — tier config that works for npm strangers and read-time `project_id`-aware retrieval trust. No new tools — the **15-tool contract holds**; all new behavior rides on existing paths.

### Added

- **Retrieval recall gate (s82 m02).** The un-runnable recall reporter became a `dist/`-backed pass/fail gate: 24 golden fixtures (8/type) re-authored against the post-flush corpus, per-type floors, a baseline-delta regression assert, and an embedder-loaded check (an adversarial reviewer caught the original check was structurally always-true; fixed). Honest baseline recorded: mission top-3 **0.25** (not the stale 43% the plan carried).
- **Mission-recall graph arm (s82 m04).** A **mission-only** 1-hop graph-neighbor arm (same `sprint_id` + `mission_dependencies`) fused as a depth-decayed third RRF term behind a default-**off** `expandGraph` (on only for `cmos_context` search). Lifts mission top-3 recall **0.25 → 0.50**; decisions/learnings unchanged (structural). A 12-agent adversarial review caught + fixed 5 real defects before close.
- **`projectType` on `cmos_project(init)` (s83 m05).** `init` now writes a `project_type` metadata row (default `build`, no-clobber on idempotent re-init) so the first onboard emits the matching `tierSelectionPrompt` (`managed` → Sprint Zero, `general` → first-session) instead of always `build`.

### Changed

- **Tier config now resolves for npm consumers (s83 m05).** `loadTierConfig` resolves against the **resolved store root** (dirname³ of the connected DB path), and falls back to the bundled `cmos-seed/tiers` when a store has no copied `cmos/tiers` (two-pass: exact tier across all dirs, then `build.md`) — fixing the silent no-op that left every auto-discovery npm consumer with a `null` tierConfig. The `agents.md` and `platform-vision.md` tier tables were rewritten as onboarding **vocabulary** only: tiers are **advisory framing, not tool gating** — every tool is always callable in every tier (the `tools_use`/`tools_skip` lists filter only advisory `suggestedAction` hints).
- **Stale-learnings flush (s82 m01).** 28 stale learnings triaged (evergreen / reaffirm / archive) so the onboard staleness banner stops being ~50% noise; the s73 leak-gap decisions were re-surfaced as active learnings; the constraint-reaffirm path folded under `cmos_context`.

### Security

- **Foreign decision/learning provenance framing at every local read surface (s83 m06).** After a `cmos_db pull`, the local `strategic_decisions` / `learnings` tables can hold rows authored in another project. `project_id` is now derived **read-time** (no migration; column-presence guarded so ancient stores degrade to `NULL` and render bare, never throw), and a **foreign** decision/learning row (its `project_id` ≠ the resolved local project) renders inside the untrusted provenance fence — while local rows stay bare — at every surface that renders such rows: mission-start "relevant decisions" (decision text **and** evidence), `cmos_context(action="search")`, `cmos_decisions(action="search")`, `cmos_learnings(action="search")`, `cmos_context(action="view")` (full + compact), `cmos_agent_onboard` "Recent Decisions", and the `cmos_review` digest's recent-decisions. Two adversarial review passes hardened this: the first caught four bare-text surfaces beyond the four originally planned (now framed); the second confirmed the decision/learning coverage is complete. Closes the SECURITY.md mission-start limitation for decision/learning content.
- **Known limitation (honestly documented, deferred):** foreign **mission / sprint / session** text (name / objective / context / title / focus from pull-merged rows) is **not yet framed** at its read surfaces (`cmos_agent_onboard` pending/blocked, `cmos_mission` list/show/status, the `cmos_review` portfolio + sprint title/focus). That is a distinct row-type sweep tracked as a follow-up; the hostile-injection exposure is gated on the parked multi-party collaboration arc (today's pulled rows are the operator's own single-owner projects). See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

### Internal

- **Mission-embedding trim — negative result (s82 m03).** Trimming the mission embedding input to name+objective did **not** lift mission recall (the "notes dilute" premise was refuted — the cause is corpus density); reverted to the 4-field input per the recorded decision. The recall win came from the graph arm (m04). No user-facing change.

## 2.2.0 — 2026-07-10

Arc D "One Portfolio Brain" — **Sprint 3, closing the arc.** T4 client-side sync convergence stops a same-owner second machine from minting duplicate dashboard project containers, the session-opener gains a machine-local "unsynced" drift signal, sprint closeout now reconciles the `next_steps` table automatically, and the master_context↔Layer-0 `project_identity` identity split-brain is fixed at the root (metadata is now the canonical identity source). No new tools — the **15-tool contract holds**; new behavior rides on existing paths.

### Added

- **T4 — same-owner sync convergence (client push-keying).** The client now ADOPTS the incumbent dashboard `(owner_id, slug)` key before every push, so a same-owner file-copy on a second machine converges into the incumbent project row instead of minting a duplicate container. The convergence reuses the existing pure-identity reconcile (`resolveAndPersistOwner` → `getMyProjects` → `selectMatchingProject`) with **zero entity merge** — it imports none of the pull-merge machinery. Three client defects that mis-routed data are fixed: `selectMatchingProject` no longer mis-adopts an arbitrary first project's slug/id in a multi-project account (single-project fallback only); `getProjectIdentity` repairs identity from the reconciled `dashboard_slug` before the directory-basename fallback so a registered store never pushes as `'Unknown'`; and the `expectedSlug` guard is relaxed to the reconciled incumbent slug **only when that incumbent was positively confirmed against a live dashboard row this cycle** (a stale/wrong slug still refuses with `EXPECTED_SLUG_MISMATCH` rather than mis-routing). Scope: **same-owner only** — the cross-account duplicate case is server-derived and stays a dashboard-side concern.
- **"Local ahead of dashboard (unsynced)" drift class on `cmos_review`.** The always-on portfolio digest now flags a store whose local writes have run more than 3 days ahead of its last dashboard-converged push from **this machine** — read for free off the registry with **no network round-trip**. It rides on the existing per-project drift list; `last_synced_at` is a new nullable column on the per-user project-graph registry (`NULL` = never-pushed-from-here = no signal, so it never false-positives), written on each converged checkpoint push. The four-bucket partition and the ≤4 KB digest budget are unchanged.
- **Closeout `next_steps` reconciliation.** `cmos_sprint(complete)` now reconciles the `next_steps` **table** (previously only the context-JSON arrays were pruned, so done-but-unmarked rows piled up). It AUTO-completes only the machine-certain subset — pending rows whose `mission_id` is a Completed, non-blocked mission of the closing sprint — CARRIES blocked-linked rows, and FLAGS the sprint-linked remainder on the receipt (`nextStepsReconciled` / `nextStepsCarried` / `pendingFlagged`). It never auto-closes on a "did it ship" guess, and never touches free-text or other-sprint rows.

### Changed

- **Project identity fields now converge across all three projections.** The mission-complete guard is the single convergence point for `{description, status, project_name}`: it stamps BOTH the master_context blob AND the Layer-0 `project_identity` row from `metadata` — the now-canonical source — so the two can no longer drift. Only those three fields are stamped (never `cmos_address` / `objectives` / `foundational_docs`, which stay user-owned). The Layer-0 row-write is failure-isolated: it can never fail a mission-complete.

### Fixed

- **Fork B — the master_context↔Layer-0 `project_identity` identity split-brain.** The Layer-0 row's `description` had gone empty while master_context held the correct string; the durability seed (`metadata.project_description` / `project_status`) was never written, so nothing re-anchored it. This release writes that seed (making metadata canonical), heals the empty Layer-0 row, and fixes the `ensureProjectIdentityRow` seed-precedence bug that seeded an empty description in the first place. With metadata as the sole edit surface, arming the convergence guard can no longer recreate the split-brain.
- **#391 — large-store file-sync** is confirmed **resolved by the dashboard's June upload-cap raise** (500 MB decompressed): a live push of the 61.4 MB store succeeded with zero errors, so no client change was needed. The silent file-sync→event-replay fallback now surfaces a structured `warnings[]` entry instead of a stderr-only log.

## 2.1.0 — 2026-07-09

Arc D "One Portfolio Brain" — Sprints 1 **and** 2. "What's happening across my projects" collapses to **one** answer path, the two registry split-brains collapse to one genuine source, and the session-opener payloads become honest and cheap. The sqlite `ProjectGraphRegistry` (keyed by `project_id`) is now the **sole** discovery store — the JSON `ProjectRegistry` and its `project-registry.json` derivation layer are **deleted** (not merely derived). Every local read pins to its sender; portfolio-wide reads are the explicit `acrossProjects=true` opt-in on the graph-backed `queryAcrossStores`.

> **Answer shapes changed (response payloads, not the input contract).** Every read now pins to the resolved project by default — no more silent cross-project fan-out. `cmos_message(list)` returns a byte-capped **summary**; the full body comes from `cmos_message(get, messageId=…)`. `cmos_review`'s portfolio reports a strict `reachable | silent | unmigrated | unreadable` partition plus a per-project drift list. The **15-tool contract holds** — new capability rides as params (`acrossProjects`) and actions (`cmos_message get`), never new tools.

### Added

- **`acrossProjects=true` on `cmos_mission` and `cmos_learnings`** (additive, matching `cmos_decisions`). `cmos_mission(status, acrossProjects=true)` returns active missions (In Progress/Current) across your registered projects; `cmos_learnings(list, acrossProjects=true, category=X)` returns learnings tagged X across projects. Both merge through the graph-backed `queryAcrossStores`, carry per-row `projectId`, surface per-store failures on `errors[]`, and emit the same metadata envelope as `cmos_decisions(acrossProjects)`.
- **`cmos_message(get, messageId=…)`** — a new **action** (not a tool) returning one message's full body, response notes, and evidence. `cmos_message(list)` now returns byte-capped **summaries** (dropping the heavy body/notes/evidence that produced a ~410 KB / 250-message overflow), with the sender labeled from the populated `senderProject` / `senderDisplayName` rather than a misleading "unknown source". The sent tab carries a user-scoped advisory.
- **Always-on cross-store `portfolio` section on `cmos_review`.** The session-opener digest carries a ≤4 KB portfolio rollup — active missions across your registered projects — built on `queryAcrossStores`. Stores are classified into a strict **partition** (`reachable` = read & fresh, `silent` = read but no CMOS write in >21 d, `unmigrated` = missions table predates the per-row rebuild, `unreadable` = other) that sums to the queried count, plus a top-N **drift** list naming the projects that need attention (with a backfill hint for un-migrated stores). Degrades to `portfolio=null` for a single-project setup. Supersedes the decision-#672 project-only exclusion.
- **Self-capture advisory on `cmos_agent_onboard` + `cmos_review`.** When your local commits run more than 7 days ahead of the last CMOS write (decision / learning / mission — sessions excluded), the opener nudges you to capture the work. Fail-open and project-local; never fires without both signals.

### Changed

- **The project-graph registry is the GENUINE single discovery source.** Every registration/mutation (`cmos_project` init/register/unregister, cwd auto-register) and every internal discovery read resolves through `~/.config/cmos-mcp/project-graph.sqlite`. There is no `project-registry.json` mirror any more; a leftover file from a pre-2.1.0 install is inert and **safe to delete**.
- **`cmos_mission(status)` / `cmos_session(list)` (and every other unpinned read) pin to the sender.** They no longer fan out across every registered project — a neutral multi-project dir now fails closed rather than returning colliding cross-project rows. "Across the portfolio" is the explicit `acrossProjects=true` opt-in.

### Removed

- **BREAKING (internal API) — the JSON `ProjectRegistry` + `project-registry.json` compat layer removed.** The JSON `ProjectRegistry` class, its `deriveJson()` / `replaceWithDerived()` derivation writers, and the five graph→JSON write sites are deleted; a ~10-line marker-gated `readLegacyJsonRegistry()` preserves the one-time v1.x→2.1.0 default-pointer migration (reads the legacy file once if present, writes nothing). Also removed: `withMultiClient` / `MultiClientEntry` (the last fan-out vestiges) and the dead `FTS5Retriever` class + sync `IRetriever` interface. None are on the package `.` export surface or the 15-tool contract — only code importing these internal helpers directly is affected. **Operator note:** `~/.config/cmos-mcp/project-registry.json` is safe to delete.

## 2.0.0 — 2026-07-09

Major release cutting the **honest surface + trustworthy base** work (sprints 76–78). One BREAKING change — the unauthenticated HTTP transport is removed — drives the major bump. The stdio server (`cmos-mcp`), which is the product, is unchanged in its tool contract: the surface holds at **15 tools** and gains only additive actions/flags. What changed is the posture: one truthful identity, a generated tool reference, machine-enforced read-only review agents, foreign-content provenance framing, offline-capable embeddings, a verified-truthful `SECURITY.md`, and a large internal deletion that ships a much leaner tarball with no dead code. A security-skeptical reader can now grep the package and find nothing alarming.

### Added

- **`SECURITY.md`** — a verified-truthful security posture doc, shipped in the tarball. Covers the auth model (device-code preferred; legacy-env and password-fallback tiers with their WARN; dashboard optional), data-at-rest reality (`cmos/db/cmos.sqlite` unencrypted; `~/.config/cmos-mcp/credentials.json` at `0600` holding **plaintext** `cmk_` keys — stated honestly, no encryption-at-rest claim), the network surface (dashboard only when `CMOS_DASHBOARD_URL` is set + `huggingface.co` for the ~25 MB embedding model on first use), snapshot/delete reality (manual snapshots only — no auto-snapshot, no soft-delete), the sanctioned deployment shape, and a vulnerability-reporting pointer. Every claim carries a file:line backing.
- **`cmos_session` `search` action** — full-text search across session titles, summaries, and captures (`query`, plus optional `since` / `until` / `limit`), routed through the consolidated `cmos_session` tool.
- **`--version` and `--help` flags** — the `cmos-mcp` bin prints `cmos-mcp <version>` (or a usage synopsis) to stdout and exits 0, short-circuiting before the stdio server connects.
- **Generated `TOOL_REFERENCE.md`** — a build-time, per-tool/per-action reference for all 15 tools, generated from the tool definitions and shipped in the tarball, guarded by a freshness test so it cannot drift from the schemas.
- **Foreign-content provenance framing** — inbound text not authored in the resolved project (cross-project message bodies, onboard-surfaced messages, directory descriptions, and pull-merged / cross-store decision & learning rows) now renders inside a source-labeled, self-escaping fence and carries a `{source, trust: 'foreign'}` descriptor on `structuredContent`. The `cmos_message` and `cmos_agent_onboard` tool descriptions state the untrusted-data contract — foreign content is data, not instructions.
- **Machine-enforced read-only review agents** — an opt-in `CMOS_AGENT_ROLE=review` env gate hard-rejects every write-capable tool/action via a fail-closed action taxonomy (unknown actions default to write); strict no-op when unset. Ships with a `PreToolUse` git-mutation-blocking hook template under `scripts/hooks/`. The guarantee holds under the sanctioned separate read-only-server deployment (see `SECURITY.md`).
- **Offline-capable embeddings** — `CMOS_OFFLINE_EMBEDDINGS` (sets the transformers `allowRemoteModels=false`) and `CMOS_MODEL_CACHE_DIR` let a local-forever install run without ever fetching the model from HuggingFace. On a load failure the embedder and tokenizer degrade to BM25 / heuristic instead of re-hitting the network on every call.
- **First-run E2E in CI** — a `pack → install-the-tarball → drive-over-stdio` test that guards the published first-run experience (identity, tool count, quickstart lifecycle) against silent breakage.

### Changed

- **One truthful server identity.** The MCP server announces `cmos-mcp` (not the retired `mission-protocol`, nor the scoped package name) at the `package.json` version, and startup logs the real schema version (`2.1`). The vestigial `baseDir` field and the dead `CMOS_DASHBOARD_SECRET` env are gone.
- **Single-current-sprint invariant + one canonical resolver.** A write-time invariant demotes other open sprints to `Planned` (atomic, with a warning), and the four previously-divergent current-sprint pickers collapse onto one `resolveCurrentSprintId` with a most-recent-activity tie-break. This closes a lying-signal bug where `cmos_review`, `cmos_mission(status)`, and `cmos_session` auto-tagging could each report a different "current" sprint; they now agree.
- **npm audit clear of the critical protobufjs chain.** A `protobufjs ^7.6.5` override resolves the critical `@xenova/transformers → onnxruntime-web → onnx-proto → protobufjs` advisory (embedding output verified byte-identical before/after). Zero critical/high remain; 4 moderate **dev-only** advisories are an accepted residual documented in `SECURITY.md`.
- **Quieter local boot.** The empty-credential-store login WARN is suppressed when no dashboard is configured (`CMOS_DASHBOARD_URL` unset), so a local-forever install boots silent; sign-up nudges point to the working `/register` route; a startup topology diagnostic warns only in the ambiguous pinned-`CMOS_PROJECT_ROOT` + multiple-registered-project case.
- **Docs truth pass.** `agents.md`, the README opener, and `docs/getting-started.md` were reconciled to reality — 15 tools via a link to the generated `TOOL_REFERENCE.md` instead of drifted hand-maintained action tables, `cmos_review` documented as the session opener, and removed live-claim references to subsystems deleted in the Great Deletion. The project's own `master_context` identity was refreshed to the open-core description.

### Removed

- **BREAKING — the unauthenticated HTTP transport is removed (hard-delete).** The `cmos-mcp-http` bin, the `./http-server` package export, the `start:http` script, the `src/http-server.ts` source, the transport docs (`HTTP_TRANSPORT.md`, `README_HTTP.md`), and the PM2 config (`ecosystem.config.js`) are all deleted. The bin exposed an unauthenticated channel — `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`, no auth, full read-write to every registered store — had no known consumers, and ran nowhere. The stdio bin (`cmos-mcp`) — the product — is unchanged. Consumers importing `@aquex/cmos-mcp/http-server` or invoking the `cmos-mcp-http` bin must pin to an earlier version; if a genuine remote-client need appears, recover the source from git history and rebuild **with authentication** rather than restoring this surface as-is.
- **`gpt-tokenizer` dependency and the GPT token-counting apparatus.** Removed the `gpt-tokenizer` dependency, the boot-time tokenizer preload (and its `[INFO] Tokenizer preload status` startup line), and the scheduled `token-validation.yml` workflow. Token counting keeps an honest Claude (`@xenova`) + Gemini (heuristic) counter; requesting `gpt` now throws `Unsupported model: gpt`. `@xenova/transformers` and the token-counter / tokenizer modules are retained.
- **Dead code and stale docs (the "Great Deletion").** Removed ~69 dead source modules and their tests, the unused domain-pack data (`templates/`, `examples/`), tracked repo cruft (`artifacts/`, `tmp/`, orphaned scripts), and ~34 `docs/` guides describing deleted or superseded subsystems plus the whitepaper. **No tool or API surface changed** — this is internal-only, verified by a two-bin import-graph reachability proof. Consumer-observable effect: a much smaller install with no misleading documentation (the tarball now ships only live `dist/`, `cmos-seed/`, `TOOL_REFERENCE.md`, and `docs/getting-started.md`).

### Security

- The single most alarming grep result — the zero-auth, `CORS *`, full-store-write HTTP channel — is gone (see Removed, BREAKING).
- Review/adversarial agents can be **machine-prevented** from writing to the store or running git-mutating commands (`CMOS_AGENT_ROLE=review`), closing the prose-only gap behind two prior data-loss incidents.
- Inbound foreign content is framed as data, not instructions, across every surface where non-project-authored text reaches agent context.
- The critical protobufjs advisory chain is cleared; the remaining posture (including the plaintext-key and no-encryption-at-rest disclosures) is documented honestly in `SECURITY.md`.

## 1.1.1 — 2026-07-07

Patch release. Four fixes — three triaged from sibling-project bug reports (aquex.ai, Synthesis-Workbench, Forge) against 1.1.0, plus an auth-resolution fix — and one build-freshness **policy change**. **Additive and non-breaking** over 1.1.0: no tools added or removed, no parameter, type, or required-field changes. The only schema-visible edit is the description of the existing `cmos_sprint` `forceComplete` parameter, now documented as a no-op (see Changed). Drop-in upgrade — no consumer action required.

### Fixed

- **Build-freshness now detects real build layouts instead of only `dist/index.js`.** `readDistBuildInfo` keeps `dist/.build-manifest.json` as the deterministic primary, then falls back to the newest-mtime file from a capped walk of the first candidate build dir that has output — `dist/` → `.next/` (excluding `.next/cache`) → `build/` → `out/`. `dist-missing` now fires only when none of those has output. This clears the permanent false `BUILD_STALE` that hit Next.js projects building to `.next/` (Synthesis-Workbench), monorepo `dist/src/` and `dist/server/entry.mjs` layouts (aquex.ai), and non-`dist` roots (Forge). A concurrent adversarial review also closed a corrupt-manifest false-pass (the manifest file is now excluded from the walk) and corrected a misleading `dist/`-only message in `cmos_review`.
- **`getCurrentSprint()` no longer surfaces a terminal sprint as "current".** The picker previously excluded only `Archived`, so `Failed`, `Dropped`, and `Reverted` sprints leaked into `currentSprint` during the review→plan gap, and a lowercase `completed` dodged the case-sensitive comparison. The terminal set is now `{Archived, Failed, Dropped, Reverted}`, case-folded, applied across every step of the selection cascade — including the Completed-aware fallbacks — so it cannot be re-defeated. Consumers no longer need to mint placeholder Active sprints to re-point the opener.
- **Write-path handler exceptions return a structured error instead of a bare `-32603`.** A tool handler that throws a non-protocol exception (e.g. a store-specific write crash on `cmos_sprint(action="complete")` or `cmos_session(action="capture")`) now returns a `CmosToolResult` error — `TOOL_EXECUTION_ERROR` with the real message, a suggestion, and a `correlationId` — as an `isError` result, instead of the generic JSON-RPC `-32603` that swallowed the cause. Genuine protocol errors (`McpError`) keep their JSON-RPC shape.
- **`cmos_db` sync ops resolve the dashboard client via the credential store, not env-only auth.** `backfill` / `reconcile` / `identify_orphans` / `purge` were the last sync surface still on `DashboardClient.fromEnv()` (env `CMOS_DASHBOARD_API_KEY` or user+password → `/api/auth/login`), so they returned `401` after a dashboard password rotation and `.env` scrub while every credential-store path kept working. They now route through `fromEnvForProject()` — credential-store key first, legacy env preserved as a script/CI fallback — so the MCP-tool path needs zero `.env` secrets. Behavior-preserving for standalone callers.

### Changed

- **Build-freshness is now advisory, never blocking (policy change).** `cmos_sprint(action="complete")` no longer blocks closeout on `BUILD_STALE`; staleness is surfaced as a warning and the sprint closes normally. `forceComplete` is retained for backward compatibility but is now a **no-op** (its parameter description says so). The running-server-stale signal on `cmos_agent_onboard` / `cmos_review` is scoped to this project and startup-manifest-gated, so it no longer reports "server is running stale code / restart required" over unrelated projects' rebuilds. This reverses the previously-blocking gate, which over-fired on foreign build layouts; the generalized probe plus advisory warnings preserve the signal without the false-positive tax.

## 1.1.0 — 2026-06-08

First public release cut from the pro tree (sprints 64–72). A drop-in minor upgrade over 1.0.1 — additive only, no breaking changes. Adds five tool/action surfaces, refreshes the bundled seed schema's cross-store indexes, and relicenses to Apache-2.0.

### Added

- **`cmos_review`** — a bundled session-opener that returns a ≤4 KB project digest (identity, current sprint, project-scoped work queue, recent decisions, freshness, and the top-3 next actions promoted to a flat field) in a single call, replacing the older `cmos_agent_onboard` + `cmos_context(view)` + `cmos_mission(status)` opener.
- **`cmos_db` `pull` / `clone` actions** — plus `slug`, `limit`, and `maxPages` parameters for paginated pulls of dashboard-mirrored project state.
- **`cmos_message` `ack` action + `acknowledged` status** — explicit acknowledgement on the cross-project messaging rail.
- **`cmos_sprint` `forceComplete`** — an operator override to close a sprint past the build-freshness gate; it records an override warning rather than closing silently.
- **`cmos_decisions` `acrossProjects`** — fan `list` out across all registered projects for a recency-ordered cross-store portfolio view, each decision tagged with its source project.

### Changed

- **Seed schema cross-store indexes.** The bundled `cmos-seed/` starter schema gains the cross-store aggregation indexes and the `author_session_id` index rename. `schema_version` stays `2.1` — the internal index rename migrates via the schema-migration path, not as a consumer-facing contract change.

### Notes

- Verified **additive-only** vs 1.0.1 (15 tools vs 14; zero removals, renames, required-parameter tightening, or type/default changes; `bin` + `exports` byte-identical), so this is a **drop-in** upgrade — no consumer action required.
- **Relicensed ISC → Apache-2.0** (permissive + attribution via `NOTICE` + patent grant). See [LICENSE](LICENSE) and [NOTICE](NOTICE).

## 1.0.1 — 2026-05-15

Patch release. Triages an OODS-Foundry-MCP intel report (2026-05-15) covering three CMOS-MCP server behaviors: one real bug fix, one verify-back to an existing fix, and one architectural item deferred to a future release.

### Fixed

- **`cmos_agent_onboard` cascade now trusts real activity over `sprints.end_date`.** When no Active/In Progress sprint exists (the steady-state for fork-and-forget projects), the cascade previously fell back to a status-and-`end_date` ordering. But `end_date` is admin-editable and frequently drifts later than the sprint's actual activity — closeout scripts and post-hoc backfills can write a date-only string (`'2026-05-14'`) that sorts after a younger sprint's ISO timestamp (`'2026-05-08T...'`). The result: `currentSprint` could surface a much older Completed sprint instead of the genuinely most-recent one. New Step 5 in `getCurrentSprint` queries `MAX(missions.completed_at, sessions.completed_at)` per non-Archived sprint and picks the highest, falling back to the legacy status-and-`end_date` ordering only when no activity rows exist. See [`src/tools/cmos/cmos-agent-onboard.ts`](src/tools/cmos/cmos-agent-onboard.ts) — `getCurrentSprint` + `getMostRecentlyActiveSprintIdIncludingCompleted`.

### Verified (no code change)

- **`cmos_session(action="complete", decisions=[…])` fan-out into `strategic_decisions`** — already shipped by Sprint 55 m02 on 2026-04-17 at `cmos-session-complete.ts:476-522`. Dedup key `(decision_text, session_id)`; `sprint_id` inherited from the session row; `decisions_fts_insert` trigger maintains FTS5 automatically. The intel report cited an example from 2026-04-16 — one day before the fix shipped. Sessions completed on or after 2026-04-17 land their `decisions[]` correctly. Historical pre-fix decisions remain in `sessions.captures` JSON and are not auto-backfilled; operator-side SQL is the right path if you want them surfaced.

### Deferred

- **PG-mirror drift between SQLite and the dashboard's Postgres replica** has been deferred to a future release. This is an architectural item, not a quick fix.

### Other

- Foundational docs and research papers (`cmos/foundational-docs/`, `cmos/research/`) swept for residual `cmos-mcp.com` references — 8 swapped to `cmos.aquex.ai`. Completes the URL cutover started in 1.0.0 (`s62-m04`), which was scoped to `.env` and runtime code.

## 1.0.0 — 2026-05-08

First public release. Published to npm as [`@aquex/cmos-mcp`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@aquex/cmos-mcp). Local-first by default; the hosted dashboard at [cmos.aquex.ai](https://cmos.aquex.ai) is optional.

cmos-mcp has been in continuous internal development since November 2025. v1.0 marks the point where the protocol surface, auth model, attribution boundary, and context layer are stable enough to draw a line and version against.

### Highlights

- 14 consolidated MCP tools with action parameters, structured error envelopes, and a uniform cold-start payload.
- Device-code auth (RFC 8628) with a per-machine credential store. No shared secrets, no env-var token paste.
- Sender attribution rebuilt around an explicit boundary module — the previous implementation could mis-attribute messages between sibling projects.
- Context v2: project identity at Layer 0, FTS5 retrieval, and a versioned blob migration system. Master context typically sits under 20KB instead of 80KB+.
- Staleness signal hygiene: auto-reaffirm-on-cite, evergreen flag, and a saner threshold default.
- Hosted dashboard is opt-in. Set `CMOS_DASHBOARD_URL` to connect; leave it unset to stay fully local.

### Auth (originally shipped Sprints 57–59)

- **`cmos_auth` tool** with `login_init`, `login_complete`, `logout`, `rotate`, `revoke`, `list`, `reissue`. Agents can run the full credential lifecycle without leaving the conversation.
- **Two-call device-code login** (`login_init` + `login_complete`) for IDE MCP hosts where stderr prompts are invisible. The legacy single-call `login` action is kept for terminal callers.
- **Per-machine credential store** at `~/.config/cmos-mcp/credentials.json`. Atomic writes, mode 0600, two trees (`userScopedKeys` and `projectKeys`) with `parentKeyId` linkage. Honors `CMOS_CONFIG_DIR`.
- **Auto-issue capture on register** — `POST /api/projects/register` returns `{key, keyId, label}` on first registration; cmos-mcp persists it transparently. Lost project keys recover on next startup via `runStartupProjectKeyRecovery()`.
- **Symmetric logout** — revokes the current user-scoped key on the dashboard and clears the local row in one atomic operation. Project-scoped child keys are deliberately not cascade-revoked.
- **Scope-aware unified revoke** — `POST /api/keys/:keyId/revoke` covers both user-scoped and project-scoped rows; the MCP determines scope locally before calling so cleanup routes correctly.
- **`whoami` + `authState` on onboard** — every cold-start payload reports `identitySource`, `authTier`, project/user keys, and last delivery observed. Surfaces `cmos_auth` suggestedActions when credentials drift.
- **Legacy-auth WARN** on stderr when falling back to `CMOS_DASHBOARD_API_KEY` or password auth, with a one-line migration pointer.

### Attribution (originally shipped Sprints 53–54)

- **Sender-context boundary module** at `src/tools/cmos/sender-identity.ts`. Single source of truth for sender attribution: matches `metadata.dashboard_project_id` first, then the local `cmos_address` against `/api/projects/me`, then fail-closed (`undefined`) — never picks a sibling.
- **Dispatcher refactor.** `CMOS_PROJECT_ROOT` no longer leaks into the tool-dispatch chain. Sender resolution is independent of working directory.
- **Self-send probe.** Sending `cmos://derek/<own>` to itself is rejected with HTTP 400. The MCP uses this as a runtime sanity check.
- **Sibling hardening.** Verified across 12 active projects post-rebuild — no cross-project mis-attribution observed.

### Context v2 (originally shipped Sprints 49–51)

- **Project identity (Layer 0)** as a first-class context type. `cmos_context(action="view", contextType="project_identity")` reads/writes the canonical identity payload — `project_id`, `cmos_address`, `platform`, `tier`, `objectives`, etc. Consumed by every onboard.
- **FTS5 retrieval** for decisions, learnings, missions, and sessions. `cmos_context(action="search")` runs relevance-scored queries with optional recency boost; the same retriever powers `cmos_decisions(action="search")` and the supersession detector.
- **Onboard v2.** `cmos_agent_onboard` returns a curated <4KB payload optimized for cold-start, with explicit warnings for staleness, sync drift, orphans, and credential issues.
- **Blob reduction.** `master_context` blobs that previously ran 86KB+ now typically sit under 20KB. Versioned blob migration system (`schema-migrations.ts` + lazy migration on read/write) lets the schema evolve without breaking existing databases.
- **Last-reviewed tracking.** Decisions and learnings carry `last_reviewed_at`; cited items get bumped automatically (see staleness hygiene below).

### Staleness hygiene (originally shipped Sprint 61)

- **Auto-reaffirm-on-cite.** Decisions and learnings cited via `citesLearningIds[]` (explicit) or detected via JS keyword overlap (implicit, floor 15) get their `last_reviewed_at` bumped automatically. Citing a learning in a session capture or mission completion treats it as fresh.
- **Threshold default 10 → 20 sprints.** `DEFAULT_STALENESS_THRESHOLD` is exported from the staleness module so downstream tools share the value.
- **Evergreen flag.** `cmos_learnings(action="update", evergreen=true)` marks an institutional rule excluded from the staleness signal. Lazy migration on first read/write of the learnings table.

### Tool-surface changes

This is the section to read carefully if you've been tracking pre-1.0 internal builds.

- **`cmos_learnings(action="update")` now requires `status` OR `evergreen`** (decision #634). Previously `status` was the only mutation field; the evergreen flag is now a peer. At least one of the two must be set per update call. Impact: any caller passing only `learningId` with no other fields will now error — pass at least `status` or `evergreen=...`.
- **14 consolidated tools.** `cmos_status` is the newest, added in v1.0 for cross-side parity with `cmos_agent_onboard.authState`. It returns five fields: `cmos_address`, `dashboard_url`, `auth_tier`, `last_sync_at`, `last_delivery_observed_at`.
- **`cmos_auth(action="logout")` is symmetric with `login`.** Logout revokes the user-scoped key on the dashboard and clears the local row atomically. Project-scoped child keys are not cascade-revoked.
- **Dashboard-not-configured is now actionable.** Tools that relay to the dashboard (sync, messaging, registry) return a structured `DASHBOARD_NOT_CONFIGURED` error with a sign-up pointer when `CMOS_DASHBOARD_URL` is unset, instead of a generic network error.
- **HTTP 402 = `DASHBOARD_UPGRADE_REQUIRED`.** Paid-tier denial (e.g., cross-user messaging from a free account) returns a typed error code with the dashboard's detail message and a sign-up URL.
- **Content-field sanitizer.** Free-text fields on write paths (`cmos_session(capture|complete)`, `cmos_mission(add|update)`, `cmos_mission_transition(complete|block|defer)`, `cmos_context(update)`) strip XML-marshalling fingerprints (`<content …>`, `<parameter …>`, `<invoke …>`, `<function_calls …>` outside code fences). The write succeeds but `sanitizedFields[]` surfaces what was trimmed — re-emit cleanly to store the full content.
- **`agentFeedback` field.** `cmos_agent_onboard`, `cmos_session(complete)`, and `cmos_mission_transition(complete)` accept an optional `agentFeedback` (≤2000 chars) to log UX rough edges. Reviewable via `cmos_feedback(action="list")`.
- **Test isolation.** Jest provisions a per-run `CMOS_CONFIG_DIR` tmpdir so the test suite never touches `~/.config/cmos-mcp/`. Set `CMOS_CONFIG_DIR` outside tests to override the default config directory.

### Packaging

- **Package name: `@aquex/cmos-mcp`** (scoped). v1.0.0 is the first public version.
- **`bin` field exposes `cmos-mcp` and `cmos-mcp-http`.**
- **`files` allowlist** ships only `dist/`, `cmos-seed/`, `LICENSE`, `README.md`. Working DB, planning docs, internal docs, and test fixtures are excluded — verified by `npm pack --dry-run`.
- **Default `CMOS_DASHBOARD_URL=https://cmos.aquex.ai`** baked at the dashboard-client level. Empty-string env values are treated as unset (avoids the IDE-spawn empty-env trap).
- **Bundled-env safety guard.** `runStartupBundledEnvCheck` warns on stderr if the server starts from `node_modules/` and finds a stray `.env` adjacent — protects against accidental secret publish.
- **`engines.node >= 18`.** No preinstall/postinstall scripts.

### URL cutover

- **`https://cmos.aquex.ai`** is the canonical dashboard URL going forward (per decision #620).
- **`https://cmos-mcp.com`** is soft-deprecated. The dashboard team's allowlist keeps it accepting in-flight clients during the transition; new installs default to the aquex.ai URL.
- The cutover is env-only — no code-level URL hardcoding survives in `src/`.

### Known issues at v1.0

- **Sync is checkpoint-driven, not continuous.** Sprint 41 replaced the continuous sync pipeline with explicit `cmos_db(action="backfill")` operations. This is the intended model — there's no plan to restore continuous sync.
- **One-way mirror.** SQLite is source of truth; Postgres is a read replica. Restoring state from a different machine requires a fresh login plus a backfill flow.
- **Cross-user messaging is paid-tier.** Same-user multi-device messaging and receive-from-paid are free. Paid-tier denial returns HTTP 402 with the structured `DASHBOARD_UPGRADE_REQUIRED` error.
- **28 evergreen-candidate learnings** flagged in the staleness audit are pending an institutional-rule sweep — operator-driven, not blocking.
- **Historical corrupted rows.** Sprint 60 surfaced 26 historical rows with XML-marshalling artifacts; the sanitizer prevents new corruption but the existing rows are report-only (run `npm run detect:corrupted` to audit).

### Migration notes

- **Coming from `cmos-mcp` (unscoped)?** The package was never publicly published under that name — internal builds installed from a tarball or git URL. Switch your MCP client config to `@aquex/cmos-mcp`:

  ```json
  { "command": "npx", "args": ["-y", "@aquex/cmos-mcp"] }
  ```

- **Existing CMOS databases are forward-compatible.** Lazy schema migrations run on first read/write. No manual migration step.
- **Custom `cmos_learnings(action="update")` callers** should pass at least one of `status` or `evergreen` per call (see Tool-surface changes above).
