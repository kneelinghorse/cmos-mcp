/**
 * Sprint 86 m03 — "say only what you know", enforced on the PARAMETER surface.
 *
 * THE DEFECT CLASS. A consolidated router reconstructs an object literal per action branch. Every
 * key it forgets is a capability an agent can name and the server will silently ignore: the call
 * returns `success: true`, the database is untouched, and no layer says a word. Three such gaps
 * were live in the shipped surface when this gate was written, one of them for years.
 *
 * ── MEASURED PRE-FIX RED BASELINE ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Measured 2026-08-11 by running THIS walker against a clean `git worktree` of 766d346. Re-measured
 * after every change to the walker's rules, because a baseline recorded against an earlier version
 * of the instrument is not a baseline — the first version of these numbers went stale under my own
 * fixes and a build-time critic caught it.
 *
 * ASSERTION A — 6 sites / 7 keys:
 *
 *   src/tools/cmos/cmos-mission.ts:321    registry
 *   src/tools/cmos/cmos-context.ts:456    statusFilter
 *   src/tools/cmos/cmos-session.ts:292    expiresAt
 *   src/tools/cmos/cmos-session.ts:304    agentFeedback
 *   src/tools/cmos/cmos-db.ts:223         perRequestTimeoutMs, overallTimeoutMs
 *   src/tools/cmos/cmos-learnings.ts:203  registry
 *
 * The plan's headline said "4 sites / 7 keys", but its own enumeration (mission criterion 9) names
 * FIVE: cmos-context.ts:456, cmos-session.ts:292, cmos-session.ts:304, cmos-db.ts:223 and
 * cmos-learnings.ts:203. So exactly ONE site is genuinely new — cmos-mission.ts:321, a second
 * `registry` seam of the same shape as the one the sweep did name. The key counts agree at 7 but
 * differ in composition: the plan's 7 includes `_getNow`, which never enters the measured red set
 * because the leading-underscore rule excludes it before scoring; the measured 7 has
 * cmos-mission.ts:321's `registry` in its place.
 *
 * ASSERTION B — 7 tools / 10 keys, recorded BEFORE any exclusion was written (the plan required
 * that ordering so an unexpectedly large red set could not be met with an invented rule):
 *
 *   cmos_mission         registry
 *   cmos_context         statusFilter
 *   cmos_session         expiresAt, agentFeedback
 *   cmos_db              perRequestTimeoutMs, overallTimeoutMs
 *   cmos_learnings       registry
 *   cmos_message         advertisedRoots
 *   cmos_agent_onboard   advertisedRoots, callerProvidedProjectRoot
 *
 * `cmos_message advertisedRoots` was invisible until a build-time critic showed that PASS-THROUGH
 * calls bypassed B entirely — 2 of 15 tools with no effective coverage, which is how an unpublished,
 * untagged MCP-boundary seam sat green beside its twin on cmos_agent_onboard, where the identical
 * key was required to carry a stated reason. Every entry is a top-level key on one of the 15
 * registered tools, so NOTHING was handed to m04: three were published and forwarded (statusFilter,
 * expiresAt, agentFeedback), two `registry` seams moved out of parameter 0, and five were tagged
 * `@internal` with a stated reason (perRequestTimeoutMs, overallTimeoutMs, both `advertisedRoots`,
 * callerProvidedProjectRoot). 3 + 2 + 5 = 10.
 *
 * ASSERTION C — empty before and after. The walk classified all 15 tools on the pre-fix tree.
 * Pre-fix rule exclusions were `_getNow` (underscore) and `client` (infrastructure-type).
 *
 * ── DISCRIMINATION IS BY RULE, NOT BY ALLOWLIST (Process Hardening #2, agents.md) ─────────────
 * There is no allowlist file and no per-site exemption anywhere in this suite. A key leaves the
 * scored set only by one of FOUR derived rules, and every one of them RECORDS what it excluded so
 * the complete set is printed on each run and growth appears in a diff:
 *
 *   underscore            a leading `_` — the in-tree convention for a test hook
 *   internal-jsdoc        an `@internal` tag WITH a stated reason; a bare tag excludes nothing
 *   outside-parameter-0   declared on a later parameter, off the caller-facing surface
 *   infrastructure-type   a positional parameter typed `CmosDatabaseClient` — a wiring seam
 *
 * Rules 3 and 4 became recorded rules only after a build-time critic pointed out that both were
 * silent: `outside-parameter-0` produced no entry at all, making "move the key to parameter 1" the
 * cheapest way to silence this gate with nothing in the printed artifact to show for it — a move
 * THIS MISSION made twice. `infrastructure-type` was a hardcoded set of four type names, three of
 * which matched nothing in the tree; it now holds only the one that is exercised, so a genuinely
 * new infra type turns the gate red and must be added in a visible diff.
 *
 * `@internal` is an allowlist with better manners unless it is constrained, so the gate also
 * asserts that every excluded key is absent from the published inputSchema of EVERY registered tool
 * — a key cannot be both internal and published.
 *
 * ── FALSE-NEGATIVE PROFILE ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A gate whose limits are undocumented is a false assurance — the same class this sprint exists
 * to close. Every hole below is KNOWN, named here rather than discovered later:
 *
 *  1. NAME FLOW, NOT VALUE FLOW. `evergreen: undefined` and `learningId: params.learningId ?? 0`
 *     both pass. The gate proves a key was written, never that a usable value arrives.
 *  2. IT STOPS AT THE HANDLER SIGNATURE. A param the handler ACCEPTS and its body ignores is
 *     invisible — which is exactly layer (c) of the `expiresAt` bug (the router forwarded nothing,
 *     but even had it, `cmos-session-capture.ts`'s newCapture literal never persisted it) and the
 *     s85-m04 SQL-omission shape. Only the real-store read-back fires cover that layer.
 *  3. THE APPLICABILITY ORACLE IS THE HANDLER'S PARAMETER TYPE. An over-declaring handler yields a
 *     false positive; an UNDER-declaring one hides a true gap. That under-declaration is why this
 *     gate is permanently blind to the motivating `evergreen` defect: at 766d346
 *     `CmosLearningsReaffirmParams` declared only `learningId` and `projectRoot`, so a
 *     declared-vs-forwarded rule has nothing to name. The build plan (§2 s86-m03 item 5) records
 *     that both directions of that rule were built and run green against the pre-fix tree; NO
 *     artifact of that run survives in this tree and this mission did not repeat it — the reason
 *     above is structural and checkable, the run is not. Making it mechanically detectable needs
 *     per-action applicability data that does not exist in the tree — s86-m04's ACTION_PARAMS,
 *     generated from this same walker via `npm run probe:router-params`.
 *  4. ASSERTION A IS EFFECTIVELY VACUOUS FOR MONOLITHIC TOOLS. They are not skipped: the walk
 *     synthesises a single `(monolithic)` branch and scores the calls in it. But those callees'
 *     parameter-0 types expose no wire keys, so A finds nothing by construction — which is why B
 *     must cover them, and why the computed shape is PRINTED with its reason.
 *  5. IT ASSUMES THE FOUR COMPUTED CALL SHAPES. Anything else is why C must FAIL rather than skip.
 *  6. A HANDLER CALLED WITH A WHOLLY LITERAL ARGUMENT is NOT-A-FORWARDING-SITE and is not scored.
 *     FOUR such calls exist today — cmos-project.ts:251 `cmosProjectList({})`, cmos-project.ts:261
 *     `cmosProjectValidate({prune: true})`, and cmos-review.ts:300/:301, whose literals sit in
 *     ternary arms. None drops anything today because their accepted sets are empty or fully
 *     supplied by the literal; if a key is added to any of those handler types, A will not see it.
 *  7. B EXCUSES A RENAME. `limit: params.searchLimit` satisfies B via the source key. If a router
 *     renamed a key to something the schema declares for an unrelated purpose, B would pass.
 *  8. NESTED SUB-OBJECT PARITY IS OUT OF SCOPE BY RULE. B compares TOP-LEVEL inputSchema properties
 *     only; `arrayUpdates.*` (cmos-context.ts:112-120 vs the property-less JSON block at :283-286),
 *     `evidence.*` and `fieldUpdates.*` belong to m04, which owns ACTION_PARAMS and the renderer.
 *  9. C HAS TEN ARMS AND ONLY FOUR ARE DEMONSTRATED. The fixtures below cover: no dispatch case for
 *     a registered tool, an ambiguous entry function, an unnameable forwarded key, and a
 *     third-level sub-router. SIX are defensive and untested — unresolvable signature, no parameter
 *     at the object-literal's position, unresolvable callee, a primitive accepting parameter,
 *     a missing dispatch source file, and a renamed `executeMissionProtocolTool`. I could not
 *     construct a TypeScript program that triggers the unresolvable-signature arm at all. They are
 *     stated as untested rather than implied to be covered.
 * 10. A UNION OR BARE-GENERIC PARAMETER-0 SCORES A VACUOUS ZERO. `createSuccess<T>(data: T)`
 *     (errors.ts:147) yields no properties, so any call whose accepting parameter is generic or a
 *     union reports `accepted: []` and can never be red. A PRIMITIVE parameter is reported to C
 *     instead, because its members are prototype methods and scoring them produced a red set of
 *     `toString, charAt, …`.
 * 11. A FORWARDING SITE INSIDE A TERNARY IS SCORED ON THE UNION OF BOTH ARMS. `projectRoot ?
 *     { projectRoot } : {}` (cmos-review.ts:300) counts `projectRoot` as forwarded. A key forwarded
 *     on only ONE arm therefore reads as forwarded — an intersection would instead report a drop on
 *     a path the caller deliberately guards, and this gate checks name flow, not value flow.
 * 12. THE GATE DOES NOT ASSERT ON `nonDelegatingCalls` (56 today). It prints them, so a handler
 *     that falls out of scoring is visible in CI output, but nothing fails if the set grows.
