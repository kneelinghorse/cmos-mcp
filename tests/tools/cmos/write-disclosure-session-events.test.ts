// ABOUTME: s86-m02b criterion 7 — the six console.warn-only session_events sites must put the DB
// ABOUTME: error in the ANSWER, plus the byte-pin on the one site that was already right.

/**
 * Sprint 86 m02b — "durable provenance was being lost with nothing in the answer".
 *
 * WHY THIS MATTERS, not just what it asserts.
 *
 * `session_events` is the append-only transition ledger — the row that says a mission moved from
 * Queued to In Progress, who moved it, and when. It is not decoration: mission history, retro
 * counts and the audit trail are reconstructed from it. Before this mission, all six
 * mission-transition handlers wrote that row, INSPECTED the result envelope, and then threw the
 * failure into `console.warn` and returned `success: true` with a clean-looking answer:
 *
 *     if (!eventResult.success) {
 *       console.warn('Failed to log mission defer event:', eventResult.error);
 *     }
 *
 * `console.warn` goes to the MCP server's stderr. The agent that called the tool reads
 * `content[0].text` — the string a `format*ForLLM` produced. So the operator was told the
 * transition completed, the provenance row was gone, and nothing anywhere in the answer said so.
 * That is this sprint's defect class exactly: reporting intent as fact.
 *
 * WHAT WOULD MAKE THIS TEST WRONG TO WRITE, and why it is written this way instead:
 *
 *  - A mock client cannot catch a wrong-table or wrong-column INSERT (agents.md Process
 *    Hardening #4 — s80-m07 shipped a `deleted_at` predicate against a column that did not
 *    exist). Every failure below is forced AT THE DATABASE by a `BEFORE INSERT` RAISE trigger on
 *    the real `session_events` table of a real temp store, so a handler writing to the wrong
 *    table would simply never trip the trigger and the case would go red.
 *  - A warning that lives only in `structuredContent` is invisible in practice. So each case
 *    asserts the DB error text in the STRING the formatter produced, reached through the same
 *    dispatcher `src/index.ts` uses (`formatMissionTransitionForLLM` / `formatMissionForLLM`),
 *    not through the leaf formatter directly.
 *  - `success` must stay TRUE (fork f09). The mission DID transition. The cure is disclosure, not
 *    abortion — so each case also reads the mission's status back out of the DB and proves the
 *    transition landed while its event row did not.
 *
 * NEGATIVE CONTROL, per case: the identical scenario with NO trigger must produce exactly one
 * `session_events` row and NO event-logging warning. Without it, a store broken for some unrelated
 * reason (missing table, wrong path, mission not found) would still look like a successful
 * reproduction — and a test that passes because everything is broken is worse than no test.
 *
 * THE SEVENTH SITE IS PINNED, NOT FIXED. `cmos-mission-complete.ts` already did both the
 * `console.warn` AND the `warnings.push` — it is the in-file reference implementation this
 * mission copied, and the mission forbids touching it. The last describe block asserts its bytes
 * AND exercises it, so it is pinned as live code rather than as a comment.
