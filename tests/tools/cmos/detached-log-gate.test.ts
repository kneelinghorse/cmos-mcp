// ABOUTME: s86-m01 structural gate — the fire-and-forget checkpoint path must not write through
// ABOUTME: the global console object, and a new detached promise-returner must not appear unseen.

/**
 * Sprint 86 m01 — a detached async body must not log through `console`.
 *
 * `triggerCheckpointBackfill` deliberately does not block its caller: cmos_sprint(complete)
 * and cmos_session(complete) start it and drop the promise, so its body routinely outlives
 * the call that started it. Under Jest that means it can still be running after a suite has
 * finished, and Jest replaces the global console object at teardown — so a late write through
 * it throws "Cannot log after tests are done". That surfaces AFTER the run reports green, as a
 * nonzero exit with every test passing. It cost a full CI investigation (decision #970) and
 * re-diagnosis in s86-m01, where the arming file turned out to be a single describe whose
 * afterEach tore down dashboard credentials while a sync was mid-flight.
 *
 * The fix is that the three modules on that path write to `process.stderr` directly, which Jest
 * does not patch. This gate keeps the fix from silently eroding on a later commit.
 *
 * DISCRIMINATION IS BY RULE, NOT BY ALLOWLIST (Process Hardening #2). There is no allowlist file
 * and no skip list. Arm A names its three modules explicitly because "the detached path" is a
 * reachability property, not a syntactic one — that set is the mission's finding, stated in the
 * ARM A comment with the reason each module is on it. Arms B and C are pure AST rules over the
 * whole tree.
 *
 * ── FALSE-NEGATIVE PROFILE (what this gate does NOT catch) ────────────────────────────────────
 * Written out rather than implied, because a gate whose blind spots are undocumented reads as
 * stronger than it is — this sprint's own defect class.
 *
 *  1. INFERRED PROMISE RETURNS. Arm B matches an explicit `: Promise<…>` return annotation. A
 *     function whose promise return is inferred (`export function f() { return g(); }`) is
 *     invisible to it. Catching those needs a full ts.Program type-checker pass, which was
 *     rejected on cost — the precedent gate in this tree (agent-prompt-tool-names.test.ts) is
 *     likewise syntax-only, and the quality gate already runs lint + format:check + 180 suites.
 *  2. A PROMISE DETACHED INSIDE AN ASYNC FUNCTION. `void doThing()` or a bare `doThing();` inside
 *     an `async` function creates the same late-log hazard, and Arm B (which requires a
 *     NON-async declaration) will not see it.
 *  3. MODULES OUTSIDE src/tools/cmos. Arm B is scoped to that directory. The three known
 *     non-async promise returners elsewhere — decisionsAcrossProjects, activeMissionsAcrossProjects
 *     and learningsTaggedAcrossProjects in src/intelligence/cross-store-queries.ts — are always
 *     returned to their caller, never detached, so scoping there buys nothing today.
 *  4. WRONG-CHANNEL WRITES. A `process.stderr.write` of a line that should have been a thrown
 *     error, or a diagnostic that should never have been emitted at all, passes every arm. This
 *     gate is about the CHANNEL, not about whether the message deserved to exist.
 *  5. EXPORTED CONST ARROW / FUNCTION-EXPRESSION DECLARATIONS. Arm B walks function DECLARATIONS.
 *     `export const f = (): Promise<void> => …` would not be matched. Arm B asserts that shape's
 *     population is currently ZERO under src/tools/cmos, so the blindness is vacuous today —
 *     disclosed here rather than papered over, and that assertion fails loudly if it stops holding.
