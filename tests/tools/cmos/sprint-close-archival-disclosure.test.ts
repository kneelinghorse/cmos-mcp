/**
 * Sprint 87 m02 — THE SPRINT-DEFINING MISSION'S GATE.
 *
 * THE DEFECT. `cmos_sprint(action="complete")` archives every active decision and learning
 * matching a three-branch disjunction — 900 of this store's 1015 decisions are in the state it
 * produces — and reports the write as `Archived: 37 decisions, 10 learnings`. Three separate
 * problems live in that sentence:
 *
 *   1. IT IS UNNAMED ON THE PUBLISHED DESCRIPTION. The router's `cmos_sprint` description lists
 *      what `complete` does and never mentions archival at all. An operator reads the tool's own
 *      contract and cannot learn that closing a sprint demotes rows.
 *   2. IT IS UNITEMISED. The counts come from the driver's `changes`. WHICH rows moved is not
 *      recorded anywhere, so a close that archived something it should not have leaves no way to
 *      find out what.
 *   3. IT IS IRREVERSIBLE. The closeout does take a DB snapshot — 134 lines and one `COMMIT`
 *      AFTER the archival. It captures the post-archival state and provides no pre-image.
 *
 * THE EMBLEM, and it is not a metaphor. sprint-86's close returned `Archived: 37 decisions`, and
 * one of the 37 was decision #1009 — the ratification of Arc F, the arc sprint-87 executes. The
 * close of the sprint that ratified this work archived the row that says what the work is. The
 * recovery worked only because an unrelated snapshot happened to land 108 seconds early.
 *
 * PRECONDITIONS ARE ESTABLISHED, NEVER INHERITED (next-step #547, BINDING ON THIS MISSION). Every
 * fact this file asserts about decision and learning rows — their status, their evergreen flag,
 * which sprint they bind to — is SET here on a store this file created. #547 exists because two
 * real-store fire tests went red in a single working day for inheriting exactly this kind of
 * property (82584cb, the `sprint_summary` view; 82429ec, the `agent_feedback` baseline, which
 * went red because the feature it asserted was unreachable started working). m02's subject is
 * the archived/active distribution, and sprint-87's OWN CLOSE will change it — so inheriting any
 * of it would make this gate a countdown to its own failure.
 *
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * MEASURED RED BASELINE — the six reds, observed on an unmodified tree before any `src/` edit.
 * Recorded in the mission close; see that record for the verbatim failures.
 *   (a) `lifecycle.archivedDecisionIds` does not exist. THIS RED IS AT TYPE LEVEL, not value
 *       level: `SprintLifecycleTriggers` carries counts only, so the property access does not
 *       compile. A red that is merely `undefined` would be satisfiable by assigning `[]`.
 *   (b) `archivedDecisionIds.length === decisionsArchived` is unstatable for the same reason,
 *       per table.
 *   (c) no pre-close snapshot exists — the only snapshot is taken after the COMMIT.
 *   (d) the ROUTER description contains no form of the word "archiv".
 *   (e) an `evergreen=1` learning bound to the sprint is archived by the close.
 *   (f) with the learnings UPDATE forced to error, the close reports `Archived: 0 decisions` for
 *       N decisions it archived AND COMMITTED.
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * WHY THE SNAPSHOT IS OPENED BY WRITABLE OPEN AND NEVER `readonly: true` (contradiction C13). A
 * WAL-mode SQLite file with no `-shm` sidecar cannot be opened read-only by the CLI's
 * `-readonly`/`mode=ro`, which needs to CREATE that sidecar: it returns `SQLITE_CANTOPEN(14)`.
 * `better-sqlite3` opens it fine. Asserting the pre-image through a readonly open would fail for
 * a reason that has nothing to do with archival, so these tests open the snapshot writably and
 * read it. That is also why m02 takes NO dependency on m03's `#535` read-only-client fix.
