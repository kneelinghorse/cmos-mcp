/**
 * Sprint 86 m02b — "say only what you know", enforced on the write side.
 *
 * THE RULE. Both `.execute(...)` and `.raw(...)` return a `CmosToolResult` envelope. Its `success`
 * flag is the only evidence that the statement ran. Code that discards it, or folds it into a
 * counter/object list with no negative arm, produces an ANSWER THAT ASSERTS SOMETHING NOT SO —
 * `nextStepsReconciled: 4` when the UPDATE errored, or `alreadyCurrent: true` when a raw CREATE
 * VIRTUAL TABLE failed. This gate makes that shape unrepresentable.
 *
 * MEASURED PRE-FIX RED BASELINE: 99 violations = 44 discarded + 49 bound-with-no-negative-arm +
 * 6 console-only. Separately and NOT counted as violations: 3 SQL-verb exemptions and 2 delegated
 * sites whose obligation moves to their call sites.
 *
 * The plan pre-committed 98 (…+ 48 bound). Both numbers are right, for different rules, and the
 * measured one wins: the plan's rule attributed a discharge by IDENTIFIER NAME anywhere in the
 * enclosing function, which cannot see cmos-session-start.ts's `let insertResult =
 * client.execute('SELECT 1')` type-placeholder — its result is overwritten by the very next
 * statement, yet a negative arm forty lines later, on the SAME name after a REBINDING, appeared to
 * discharge it. This gate attributes discharge PER BINDING (see DischargeWindow), which sees it.
 * 99 - 98 = that one site.
 *
 * s88-m09 RAW BASELINE, RE-DERIVED BEFORE THE FIX: 18 production code calls = 9 discarded +
 * 5 bound-with-no-negative-arm + 4 inspected. All 18 were in schema-migrations.ts. The exact
 * publishable command excludes the doc-comment occurrence of `client.raw()`:
 *
 *   rg -n --glob '*.ts' --pcre2 '^(?!\s*(?://|/\*|\*)).*\.raw\s*\(' src \
 *     | tee /dev/stderr | wc -l
 *
 * CURRENT POST-FIX SHAPE: 5 production calls, still all in schema-migrations.ts. Two are the
 * centralized `ensureVirtualTableObject` / `ensureSchemaTrigger` calls nested directly in
 * `checkWrite`; three have explicit negative arms. The 14 baseline violations therefore no
 * longer exist as individual raw sites. The fourth formerly inspected site — the decisions_fts
 * virtual-table CREATE — also moved into the guarded helper so its failure is diagnostic rather
 * than merely returning `alreadyCurrent: false`.
 *
 * DISCRIMINATION IS BY RULE, NOT BY ALLOWLIST (Process Hardening #2, agents.md). There is no
 * allowlist file and no per-site exemption list anywhere in this suite. The ONE exemption —
 * transaction verbs on already-failing paths — is DERIVED from the SQL string argument
 * (`/^\s*(BEGIN|COMMIT|ROLLBACK)\b/i`), so a bare non-transaction `execute` added inside a
 * `catch` clause is still caught. Patching a bare ROLLBACK would mask the original failure,
 * which is why the exemption exists at all; deriving it from the SQL is why it cannot grow.
 *
 * WHY A JEST AST TEST AND NOT A CUSTOM ESLINT RULE — recorded so a later sprint does not
 * re-litigate it. The precedent is in-tree (tests/tools/cmos/agent-prompt-tool-names.test.ts and
 * tests/tools/cmos/event-type-coverage.test.ts both walk source from jest), `typescript` is
 * already a devDependency, and bucket (b) needs CALL-SITE resolution across files — a delegated
 * `return client.execute(...)` moves the obligation to the callers of the enclosing function.
 * ESLint's per-file model makes that cross-file step awkward; a jest test just reads the tree.
 *
 * ── FALSE-NEGATIVE PROFILE ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * This gate proves a result is INSPECTED. It does not, and cannot, prove the inspection is
 * CORRECT. Every limit below is a KNOWN hole, named here rather than discovered later:
 *
 *  1. SHAPE, NOT SEMANTICS. `if (!r.success) { /* best effort *\/ }` passes the gate and tells
 *     the operator nothing. So does an arm that pushes a warning into a sink no formatter
 *     renders. The gate is a floor, not a proof of disclosure.
 *  2. RAW better-sqlite3 IS INVISIBLE. `db.prepare(...).run()` — used at cmos-project-init.ts
 *     (the fresh-store bootstrap, ~:479-508) and throughout tests/ — is not a client envelope
 *     call and is never walked. That is OUT OF SCOPE BY CONSTRUCTION, not by oversight: `.run()`
 *     THROWS on failure rather than returning a result envelope, so it is a different failure
 *     mode with a different remedy (try/catch). `CmosDatabaseClient.raw(...)` DOES return an
 *     envelope and is covered by the same rule as `.execute(...)`.
 *  3. THE CONSOLE-ONLY TIGHTENING IS A HEURISTIC OVER ARM CONTENT. An arm whose entire body is a
 *     `console.*` call does not count as inspection — that rule is what catches the six
 *     session_events sites, and without it this gate is green while durable provenance is lost.
 *     But it reads the arm's SHAPE, and there are at least three ways past it:
 *       (a) an arm that reaches a logger through an indirection (`log.warn(...)`, a helper, a
 *           bound method) is not recognised as console-only;
 *       (b) HOISTING THE NEGATION out of the `if` defeats it entirely —
 *           `const failed = !r.success; if (failed) { console.warn(...); }` has no arm this gate
 *           can attribute, so it takes the `inspectionOutsideAnIf` path below and reads as
 *           `inspected`. Same for a ternary (`const label = !r.success ? 'no' : 'yes'`).
 *       (c) `inspectionOutsideAnIf` is a deliberate escape hatch for `return !r.success ? … : …`
 *           and `if (!a.success || !b.success)` shapes we cannot attribute an arm to. It grants
 *           `inspected` WITHOUT the console-only check ever running. Zero sites in the current
 *           tree reach it, so it costs nothing today — but it is the widest hole here.
 *  8. THE NEGATIVE TEST MAY LIVE IN A NESTED FUNCTION. `findNegativeTests` walks into nested
 *     function bodies, so an inner closure that happens to use the same parameter name can
 *     discharge an outer site. Scoping is by enclosing function and binding position, not by
 *     true lexical resolution.
 *  9. `client['execute'](…)` / `client['raw'](…)` (element access) is not a candidate —
 *     `isWriteEnvelopeCall` requires a PropertyAccessExpression. Plain, non-dynamic, invisible.
 * 10. THE SWEEP COVERS `src/` ONLY. `scripts/` is not walked, and it contains bare discarded
 *     writes today. That is why this mission's `scripts/measure-cross-store-baseline.ts` fix had
 *     to be made and tested BY HAND — no gate protects it.
 *  4. THE READ SIDE IS NOT WALKED AT ALL. `getOne` / `getMany` have the identical defect —
 *     a failed SELECT that reads as "no rows" — and this gate says nothing about them (fork f10).
 *     Two read-side sites were fixed by hand in this mission (scripts/measure-cross-store-
 *     baseline.ts `safeCount`, cmos-session-complete.ts persistContext's existence SELECT)
 *     precisely BECAUSE no gate will catch a regression there.
 *  5. DYNAMIC DISPATCH IS INVISIBLE. A write reached through a callback, a method looked up on a
 *     record, or any indirection that does not spell `.execute(` / `.raw(` in the source is not
 *     a candidate.
 *  6. IT SAYS NOTHING ABOUT A WRITE THAT SUCCEEDS WITH THE WRONG VALUE. `success: true` on an
 *     UPDATE that matched the wrong rows is, to this gate, a clean write.
 *  7. IT CANNOT JUDGE WHETHER `changes === 0` IS MEANINGFUL. A zero from a WHERE that matched
 *     nothing is legitimate; a zero from a statement that errored is not. `countWrite` moves that
 *     judgement to the call site, where the caller knows whether the id set was re-selected under
 *     the same predicate (cmos-sprint-complete.ts) or supplied by the caller (cmos-next-steps.ts).
