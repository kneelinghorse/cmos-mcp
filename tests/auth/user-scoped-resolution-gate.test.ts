/**
 * Sprint 86 m06 — the three invariants that hold this fix in place.
 *
 * Two of them are UNOBSERVABLE behaviourally today, which is exactly why they need a gate
 * rather than a test:
 *
 *  - `defaultClientFactory` in project-key-capture resolves user-scoped, but the startup
 *    runner only reaches it after proving no local project row exists, so the project-scoped
 *    and user-scoped entry points behave identically there. A behavioural test for it would
 *    be a test that cannot fail. What CAN be gated is the structure: no code under `src/auth/`
 *    may resolve through the project-scoped entry point, and a future "no-op simplification"
 *    that reverts it must go red here.
 *  - The authenticating-keyId setter has exactly one call site. Spraying it across the
 *    resolution arms is the rejected fix: the field never reaches the wire, so stamping it in
 *    an arm that authenticates with a project key records an attribution the request does not
 *    support — a lie that looks like a fix.
 *
 * FALSE-NEGATIVE PROFILE, written rather than discovered later. This gate reads TEXT, so:
 *  (1) it cannot see a project-scoped client passed INTO `src/auth/` from a caller outside it
 *      — `classifyAttribution` rule 5 is the runtime backstop for that, covered in
 *      reissue-resolution.test.ts;
 *  (2) it cannot see resolution reached through an alias or a dynamic property access
 *      (`const f = DashboardClient['fromEnvForProject']`);
 *  (3) it counts CALL SITES, not mentions — comments and doc prose that name the chain are
 *      deliberately allowed, because describing why the change exists is the point. The rule is
 *      an identifier followed by `(`, so it is strict in one direction: a comment that writes the
 *      name WITH parentheses would be counted as a call site. That is a false POSITIVE (it fails
 *      loudly, it does not silently permit), which is the safe direction for a gate;
 *  (4) it says nothing about whether the resolved credential is CORRECT, only which entry
 *      point produced it.
 * Each check below therefore carries a premise assertion proving the pattern can still match
 * something, so a rename cannot silently turn the gate into a tautology.
 *
 * ZERO ALLOWLIST ENTRIES.
