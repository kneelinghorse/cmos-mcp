/**
 * Sprint 86 m05 — INSTRUMENT 3: SHIPPED-PROSE TRUTH.
 *
 * ═══ THE DEFECT CLASS, AND WHY TWO PRIOR ARCS MISSED IT ═══
 * README.md and SECURITY.md ship in the SAME npm tarball and contradicted each other on three
 * data-loss guarantees — soft deletes via `deleted_at`, an automatic snapshot before destructive
 * operations, and a `dry_run` flag. README asserted all three; SECURITY.md, under a heading
 * literally called "Backups & deletion — the honest reality", denied all three. That
 * contradiction shipped in 2.3.0, 2.4.0 and 2.5.0.
 *
 * `git log -L 216,232:README.md` dates that block to 2026-05-07 (826f542, s62-m01) — BEFORE Arc B
 * ("everything documented is true") and before Arc C (which authored SECURITY.md). Both arcs
 * closed over it because both verified GENERATED artifacts against their generators, and prose
 * has no generator. This file is that generator's replacement: not a proofread, a resolver.
 *
 * ═══ MEASURED RED BASELINE (2026-08-12, pre-fix tree) — 13 findings, no false positives ═══
 *   identifier arm (8): `deleted_at` at README.md:218 (0 in the seed schema, 0 in src/ CODE — the
 *                      only two src/ mentions are JSDoc saying the column does NOT exist);
 *                      `CMOS_AUTO_SNAPSHOT` and `CMOS_SNAPSHOT_RETENTION_DAYS` at README.md:194-195
 *                      and agents.md:403-404 (0 reads anywhere in src/ or scripts/); `dry_run` at
 *                      README.md:221 (0 in src/ — the real param is `dryRun`, on 2 of 15 tools);
 *                      and `valid_values` at README.md:214 and agents.md:138.
 *   contradiction arm (5): the CMOS_AUTO_SNAPSHOT / CMOS_SNAPSHOT_RETENTION_DAYS / deleted_at
 *                      trio, asserted in README.md and agents.md, denied in SECURITY.md.
 *
 * `valid_values` was NOT in the build plan's fix list — the gate found it. Both README.md and
 * agents.md document the error envelope as carrying `valid_values` and `current_state`, while
 * every error the code actually emits uses `validValues` / `currentState` (errors.ts:218,
 * cmos-next-steps.ts:80, and the `result.error.validValues` reads in five routers). A consumer
 * writing `if (err.valid_values)` against the documented shape gets `undefined` forever. Same
 * class as the trio, found by rule rather than by having been noticed.
 *
 * ═══ DIRECTION OF FIX IS ONE-WAY ═══
 * SECURITY.md is the correct document. Every fix moved README.md and docs/getting-started.md
 * TOWARD it, and each claim was re-proven against SOURCE (grep the identifier, read the schema),
 * never against SECURITY.md's prose. That ordering is not a style preference: SECURITY.md's
 * claims are the ones a security reader relies on, and "make the docs agree" would have been
 * satisfied just as well by deleting the true statement.
 *
 * ═══ RESOLUTION CORPUS — WHY CODE AND NOT `grep src/` ═══
 * A token resolves against src/ and scripts/ CODE (AST identifiers + string literals), the seed
 * schema, package.json `scripts`, and package.json `files`. Comments are excluded, and that is
 * load-bearing rather than tidy: `deleted_at` appears twice in src/, both times inside JSDoc
 * saying *"that column does not exist"*. A raw `grep src/` would have resolved the token and
 * passed the very defect this gate exists to catch.
 *
 * ═══ THE NEGATION RULE (no allowlist, and SECURITY.md must stay sayable) ═══
 * A document naming an identifier in order to DENY it is not claiming it exists. SECURITY.md
 * says `CMOS_AUTO_SNAPSHOT`, `CMOS_SNAPSHOT_RETENTION_DAYS` and `DB_PATH` "are vestigial — no
 * code reads them", which is TRUE and is exactly the disclosure a reader needs. Without a
 * negation rule this gate would fire on the honest document and the only way to green it would
 * be an allowlist — the failure mode this sprint exists to close. So a token inside a negated
 * sentence is excluded BY RULE, and the same rule is what lets the contradiction arm read
 * SECURITY.md's denials as the authority they are.
 *
 * ═══ FALSE-NEGATIVE PROFILE ═══
 *   - A claim made in prose with no backticked token ("snapshots are taken automatically") is
 *     invisible to both arms. The contradiction arm reaches it only when SECURITY.md's denial
 *     carries a backticked token.
 *   - A token that exists but means something else — a real column named in a false claim about
 *     its behavior — resolves and passes. Existence is not semantics.
 *   - A contradiction between two documents that BOTH state a claim positively (neither denies
 *     the other) is invisible; the arm keys on an explicit denial.
 *   - camelCase identifiers are not checked (too many are prose words). Exactly three token
 *     shapes are: ENV-shaped (`CMOS_*`), snake_case, and `npm run <script>`. PATHS ARE NOT
 *     CHECKED HERE — path reachability belongs to Instrument 1
 *     (tests/tools/cmos/agent-prompt-reachability.test.ts), which owns the package.json
 *     files[]+bin oracle and the freshly-init'd-root fire test. An earlier revision declared a
 *     'path' token kind that nothing ever constructed, which claimed coverage this file does
 *     not have — the same defect it exists to catch.
 *
 * ═══ EXCLUDED FROM THE TARGET SET, with the rule reason — printed by the gate ═══
 * See EXCLUSIONS below. The gate PRINTS them, because a silent exclusion is this sprint's own
 * defect class.

/**
 * s89-m02 — ROLE-BEARING SHIPPED PROSE.
 *
 * Scope and false-negative profile are one document, per decision #1063. This arm checks only
 * roles with a shipped mechanical oracle:
 *
 * R1 COLUMN-OF-TABLE — simple Markdown pipe tables whose header has exactly one cell containing
 * "column" and whose data row starts with one backticked table/view name. The named object's
 * columns come from executing cmos-seed/db/schema.sql in memory and reading PRAGMA table_info.
 * R2 EXECUTABLE SQL — semicolon-delimited statements in sql fences are prepared, never executed,
 * against that same seed-schema database.
 * R3 TOOL/ACTION — call-like prose in the form cmos_name(action="value"...), with action first,
 * is checked against CMOS_TOOL_DEFINITIONS and the named tool's action enum.
 *
 * ROLE_COMPLEMENT below is binding, not an allowlist: each unchecked role states why this parser
 * cannot adjudicate it honestly. In particular, R1 does not infer arbitrary prose or non-pipe
 * tables; R2 does not understand statements constructed across fences or runtime-only schema;
 * and R3 does not claim actionless calls, JSON/MCP syntax, action after another argument, or
 * dynamic action prose. A real identifier in a false semantic claim can still pass every arm.

 *
 *   (i)   `process.env.NAME` / `process.env['NAME']`
 *   (ii)  `process.env[CONST]` where CONST is a module-level string constant —
 *         CMOS_CONFIG_DIR_ENV, the four dashboard-client *_ENV constants, CMOS_PROJECT_ROOT_ENV,
 *         CMOS_PROJECT_ID_ENV, STALENESS_THRESHOLD_ENV, CMOS_CHECKPOINT_SYNC_ENV
 *   (iii) a member read on a `NodeJS.ProcessEnv`-typed PARAMETER that defaults to process.env —
 *         read-only-agent-guard.ts (`env[READ_ONLY_AGENT_ENV]` → CMOS_AGENT_ROLE),
 *         transformers-offline-env.ts (`env.CMOS_OFFLINE_EMBEDDINGS`,

 *   (iv)  a helper taking the name as a string literal — envFloat/envOptFloat/envOptInt in
 *         scripts/measure-retrieval-production.ts
 *
 * FALSE-NEGATIVE PROFILE: a name assembled at runtime (`process.env['CMOS_' + suffix]`), a name

/**
 * s87-m04 + s88-m03 + s88-m07 — ARC F ITEM 3, ALL BOLD SHIPPED SEED-MARKDOWN STAMPS.
 *
 * #1009's enumeration named the seed's stale stamps as an Arc F item. The schema-version and tool-
 * count claims are checkable against something the tarball itself ships. s88-m03 performed the
 * required per-file review and corrected all eight bold **Last Updated** stamps in shipped seed
 * Markdown. s88-m07 replaces its release-date proxy with the body-change oracle: git is available
 * at TEST time, so a stamp must be at least as recent as the file's latest non-stamp body change.
 * Stamp-only edits are ignored. A real temporary npm tarball supplies the files and stamp bytes.
 * The oracle follows committed renames, compares merge diffs per parent, and treats a tracked
 * working-tree body edit as a change today. It fails loudly when a file is untracked, history is
 * shallow/unavailable, or a file's lineage combines a committed rename with a merge — git --follow
 * cannot prove per-parent paths for that bounded composition, so it is never allowed to silently
 * green. It runs in both source repositories;
 * a public-mirror transport commit therefore counts at that repository's committer date. This is a
 * necessary freshness relation, not proof that a human reviewed the prose: a dishonest stamp-only
 * bump remains outside what git can establish. Lowercase prose-like source-code comments are
 * outside this deliberately bold-Markdown contract, and date-only stamps cannot distinguish two
 * body edits made on the same calendar day.
 *
 * THE PACKED-CONTENT ARM ALWAYS RUNS. `cmos-seed/**` is not mirror-excluded, so the public clone
 * still verifies the stamp count, syntax, future-date bound, schema version, and tool count. The
 * one private-history comparison is scoped separately: a mirror release commit re-dates private
 * body changes, so public Git history cannot establish when the private source body changed.
 * Treating that mirror commit date as source provenance produced this suite's public false RED.
