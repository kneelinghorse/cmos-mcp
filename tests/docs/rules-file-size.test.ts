/**
 * WHY (decision #1183; design doc cmos/planning/s93-the-loop-runs-itself-build.md, m12 fork 6).
 * agents.md was 98,095 bytes, two-thirds of it architecture reference, and Codex reads the first
 * 32 KiB of a rules file. The reference moved to cmos/docs/architecture.md, linked from agents.md,
 * and CLAUDE.md imports agents.md so Claude Code loads every rule rather than a pointer to them.
 *
 * Private evidence: agents.md, CLAUDE.md and cmos/ are not mirrored, so the public repository skips
 * this block by scope (tests/helpers/public-mirror.ts), and says so.
