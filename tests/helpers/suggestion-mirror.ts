// ABOUTME: Provenance instrument for authored error `suggestion:` strings — an AST source transform
// ABOUTME: into a gitignored CommonJS mirror, so a fired suggestion names the src/ site that authored it.

/**
 * WHY A SOURCE TRANSFORM AND NOT A STRUCTURED FIELD (s89-m08, FORK 2).
 *
 * An oracle that drives a router and reads back `error.suggestion` sees a STRING. To assert
 * anything about the SITE that authored it, the site has to be recoverable from the string —
 * and it is not. Regex-attributing observed suggestions back to AST string literals was measured
 * at plan time and could not attribute 25 of 53 distinct observed suggestions, because every
 * interpolated template (`errors.ts:319/333/466`) yields an unmatchable anchored pattern.
 *
 * Making `suggestion` a structured `{text, remedy}` object would be a BREAKING change to
 * `CmosToolError` on the MCP wire, across 181 sites, in the sprint whose own review dinged 2.8.0
 * for shipping an undisclosed wire break. An additive `remedy?:` field beside `suggestion` avoids
 * the break but still costs 181 authoring edits AND creates a second source of truth that can
 * silently disagree with the string — the precise defect class Arc F is named for.
 *
 * So the harness carries the provenance instead of the source: every `suggestion:` initializer `E`
 * is rewritten to `(globalThis.__CMOS_SUGGESTION_SITE__("<relpath>:<line>", E))`, which records the
 * site and returns `E` unchanged. ZERO `src/` edits. The shipped bytes are what ships.
 *
 * WHY `.js` AND NOT `.ts` (proven at plan time). `preset: 'ts-jest'` transforms `^.+\.tsx?$` and
 * tsconfig declares `rootDir: "./src"`, so importing a mirrored `.ts` from outside `src/` invites a
 * ts-jest/rootDir interaction with no clean fix. Emitting CommonJS `.js` via `ts.transpileModule`
 * sidesteps the transform entirely, and `collectCoverageFrom: ['src/**\/*.ts']` never matches it.
 *
 * MIRROR INTEGRITY IS LOAD-BEARING. A harness that is not testing the shipped code must fail
 * loudly, so `buildSuggestionMirror()` proves — every run, never cached — that removing exactly the
 * spans it recorded restores every `src/` file byte-for-byte by SHA-256. If that check ever fails,
 * the mirror is testing something other than the shipped source and the suite is meaningless.
 *
 * THE MIRROR IS AN INSTRUMENT, NOT A BUILD. It is written under `node_modules/.cache/`, which is
 * gitignored, outside jest `roots: ['<rootDir>/tests']` and outside `collectCoverageFrom` — and is
 * not part of any mirror exclusion. See MIRROR_ROOT for why that placement remains load-bearing.

/**
 * The mirror lives under `node_modules/.cache/`, NOT under `<repo>/tmp/`.
 *
 * MEASURED REASON, and it is not a style preference. `tmp` is a PRIVATE_PATHS leak guard. The old
 * classifier treated every exclusion as an identity marker, so writing the mirror into
 * `<repo>/tmp/` made 13 later suites throw instead of skip in a staged public mirror. Identity now
 * uses excluded paths tracked in the checkout's HEAD/index, but scratch placement still avoids
 * every exclusion: that keeps generated data out of the mirror surface and survives a future
 * tracking change.
 *
 * `node_modules/.cache/` has every property `tmp/` was chosen for — gitignored, outside jest
 * `roots: ['<rootDir>/tests']`, outside `collectCoverageFrom: ['src/**\/*.ts']` — and additionally
 * resolves `<repo>/node_modules` from inside itself, while being no part of any mirror exclusion.
