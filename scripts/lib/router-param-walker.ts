/**
 * Sprint 86 m03 — "no consolidated router may declare a parameter it silently drops".
 *
 * ONE WALKER, TWO CONSUMERS, DELIBERATELY (critic 2, major 2). This module is imported by BOTH
 * `tests/tools/cmos/router-param-forwarding.test.ts` (the gate) and `scripts/probe-router-params.ts`
 * (the codegen entry point `npm run probe:router-params`, which s86-m04 uses to generate its
 * ACTION_PARAMS first cut). A jest test is not invokable as a codegen step, and two copies of this
 * walk would drift on the unwrap trap documented below. Nothing new ships: `scripts/` is absent
 * from package.json `files[]`.
 *
 * ── THE NON-OBVIOUS AST MECHANIC ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The forwarded object literal is wrapped in a `satisfies` or `as` expression in NINE of the
 * routers — `satisfies` in cmos-learnings / decisions / sprint / db / mission / mission-transition /
 * project, `as` in cmos-context / cmos-session, and cmos-project carries one of each — so
 * `ts.isObjectLiteralExpression(call.arguments[0])` is FALSE for them.
 *
 * MEASURED, not assumed: deleting only the satisfies/as arm of `unwrap()` moves 49 calls from
 * OBJECT-LITERAL to NOT-A-FORWARDING-SITE (67 -> 18). POSITIONAL is unchanged at 13, so the
 * once-stated "reports (positional) for every one of them" was wrong. The consequence is worse than
 * that phrasing suggested in one direction and different in the other: assertion A goes VACUOUSLY
 * GREEN (nothing left to score), while assertion B turns RED on a false positive — `cmos_context
 * types`, whose rename source `params.searchTypes as RankedResultType[]` is lost with the unwrap.
 * That is why this lives in exactly one place.
 *
 * ── WHAT IS DERIVED, NOT CONFIGURED ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * There is no tool→handler map in this file. The map is READ from the real dispatch: the
 * `executeMissionProtocolTool` switch in src/index.ts, where each `case '<toolName>':` binds its
 * entry function as the initializer of a `result` variable. A registered tool with no case, or a
 * case with no such call, is an assertion-C failure — not a skip.

 * removed; a genuinely new infra type turns the gate RED and must be added in a visible diff.

 *
 *   • SWITCH-ROUTER  → the union of every OBJECT-LITERAL **and PASS-THROUGH** delegated handler's
 *     accepted keys. Those are the sets whose members are wire KEYS. This is what makes B red on
 *     the reachability gaps: `CmosSessionCaptureParams` accepts `expiresAt` while cmos_session's
 *     inputSchema did not declare it. PASS-THROUGH was added after a build-time critic showed its
 *     omission left cmos_auth and cmos_message with an EMPTY B oracle — 2 of 15 tools with no
 *     effective coverage from either assertion, which is how `advertisedRoots` stayed unpublished,
 *     untagged and green on cmos_message while its twin on cmos_agent_onboard had to carry a tag.
 *
 *   • MONOLITHIC     → the entry function's own parameter-0 keys, since there is no delegate.
 *     Assertion A is vacuous for these tools by construction, so B is their only coverage.
 *
 *   • POSITIONAL callees contribute NOTHING to B — deliberately. A positional parameter's name is
 *     a local of the callee (`reaffirmConstraint(client, id, evergreen)` → `id`), not a published
 *     key; the published key is `constraintId`. Treating `id` as a surface obligation would make B
 *     red on a name that was never a wire contract. Those callees are still fully covered by
 *     assertion A, which checks SUPPLY rather than naming.
 *
 *   • RENAMES ARE NOT GAPS. A router may rename on the way through — cmos_context forwards
 *     `limit: params.searchLimit` and `types: params.searchTypes`. The handler key `limit` is not
 *     on the inputSchema and never should be; `searchLimit` is. So B is satisfied when EITHER the
 *     accepted key OR the router key it was forwarded from is declared. Requiring the handler's
 *     own name would demand publishing an internal name — a lie in the opposite direction.
